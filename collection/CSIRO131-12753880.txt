Note: Research Program activity is not confined to one specific laboratory, with most Programs having staff operating out of several of our laboratory sites. Agricultural Landscapes: focused on the interface between agriculture and the environment. In partnership with rural industries, communities, and governments, our research aims to improve ecological integrity and economic performance of agricultural landscapes. more Laboratories undertaking Agricultural Landscape research: APSRU Office, Qld DPI, Toowoomba Centre for Environment and Life Sciences, Perth Gungahlin Homestead, Canberra Queensland Bioscience Precinct, Brisbane Rangelands and Savannas: studying the ecology and sustainable management of the vast landscapes in Australia's interior and north. Research areas include general rangeland systems, the arid lands of the outback deserts and semi-deserts, and the tropical savanna and grassland environments of Australia's top end. more Laboratories undertaking Rangeland and Savanna research: Centre for Arid Zone Research, Alice Springs Davies Laboratory, Townsville Gungahlin Homestead, Canberra Queensland Bioscience Precinct, Brisbane Tropical Ecosystems Research Centre, Darwin Resource Futures: examing regional and national development issues, population-development-environment debate, natural resource management options and scenarios from socio-environmental-economic models. Studies are focused upon resource futures at a national level, in urban and regional environments , as well as in northern Australia. The concepts of economic interaction with ecosystem services and resource governance are also examined. more Laboratories undertaking Resource Futures research: Davies Laboratory, Townsville Gungahlin Homestead, Canberra Queensland Bioscience Precinct, Brisbane Tropical Landscapes: examining the landscapes and industries of tropical North East Australia and issues such as conservation, biodiversity and ecology in tropical rainforests, sustainable opertation of tropical agricultural production systems such as sugar cane, and issues of landuse management in the face of climate change. more Laboratories undertaking Tropical Landscape research: Davies Laboratory, Townsville Queensland Bioscience Precinct, Brisbane Tropical Forest Research Centre, Atherton Urban Systems: developing new technologies and providing integrated infrastructure solutions to reduce Australia&rsquo;s urban ecological footprint and increase infrastructure effectiveness. more Laboratories undertaking Urban Systems research: Highett Laboratories, Melbourne Gungahlin Homestead , Canberra North Ryde Offices, Sydney Queensland Bioscience Precinct, Brisbane CSE Research Client Services Labs &amp; Locations This page last updated 11 September, 2006 Legal Notice & Disclaimer and Privacy Statement © Copyright CSIRO Australia 2000 - 2006
