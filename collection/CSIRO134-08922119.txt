SedNet sediment network modeling softwareSedNet is a simple, testable, physically-based distribution model for catchment sediment transport which, by modeling sediment transport, can give healthier catchments and rivers. Underground communications system improves mine safetyCSIRO's new underground communications system provides timely and useful information for improved mine safety. Audio   Cold water eddy ‘monsters” mighty current off Sydney (Podcast 20 Mar 07)In this six-minute podcast Dr David Griffin, from the Wealth from Ocean's Flagship, explains how a huge dense eddy was the reason the sea was so cold off the coast of NSW this summer. DataTraceDNA takes up fight against fake art fraudsters (Podcast 2 Mar 07)Mr Greg Twemlow from DataTraceDNA explains how technology developed by CSIRO is tackling the problem of fake art in this six-minute podcast. Great white shark’s incredible journey (Podcast 2 Nov 06)Mr Barry Bruce talks about a female great white shark who travelled thousands of kilometres around the Australian coast in this seven-minute podcast. Keeping track of Australia’s water (Podcast 20 Feb 07)Dr Rob Vertessy discusses the Water Resources Observation Network (WRON) in this five-minute podcast, and why it’s so important to Australia. Capability   Creating machines that sense and respondOur expertise combining intelligent sensors and computing leads to machines and products that can interact with their environment and alter the way they function. Exploring the new physics of the nanoscaleCSIRO’s large, integrated team of professional scientists and engineers research the new physics of the nanoscale. They cover biomimetics, nanoparticle films, biosensor arrays and molecular electronics. Giving machines visionCSIRO’s Machine Vision team is expanding the capabilities of visioning hardware-software, building machines able to automatically process images in real-world conditions. It's not rocket science... it's rockin' scienceWearable intelligent textiles, incorporating electronic circuitry and sensors, are well suited to become the basis of the next generation of control systems for many applications of mobile computing, allowing complete freedom of movement. Managing complex systemsCSIRO is applying systems and complexity theory to optimise the performance and efficiency of market areas such as manufacturing, mining, infrastructure, logistics and security. Predicting and reporting for natural resource managementCSIRO is leading the development of modelling technology for natural resource management in Australia and our prediction and reporting technologies will allow natural resource managers to model scenarios digitally and save millions of dollars. Understanding artificial intelligenceWith the development of advanced artificial intelligence technology, CSIRO scientists are taking automated systems process to a new level of capability. Utilising remote sensing dataCSIRO develops applications that make use of remote sensing data to help spot bushfires in remote areas, predict the weather and map land, vegetation and oceans. Feature Article   Giving yachties a competitive edgeOceanographers are using satellite images to identify a range of features important in understanding the ocean around Australia – sea surface heights, water temperatures, current speed and direction. Media Release   CSIRO builds smart farm (Media release 14 Sep 06)CSIRO is working towards the 'Smart Farm' of the future with research focussing on Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and their potential to transform the Australian agriculture industry. CSIRO imagery shows outer Great Barrier Reef at risk from river plumes (Media release 22 Feb 07)A stunning series of satellite imagery of Australia’s Great Barrier Reef released by the CSIRO shows for the first time visual confirmation of the theory that sediment plumes travel to the outer reef, and beyond. CSIRO, Medic Vision and University of Melbourne commercialise VR ear surgery training system (Media release 7 Jul 06)The CSIRO ICT Centre, Medic Vision Pty Ltd and the University of Melbourne have signed an agreement for the commercial development of a virtual reality (VR) system for teaching temporal bone surgery. Mini sensors to help in the fight against corrosion (Media release 9 May 06)A novel array of sensors designed by CSIRO is poised to change the costly and resource-intensive process of fighting corrosion in industries such as aerospace, shipping, mining, oil and gas. Science, Sailing and a great ocean current (Media release 22 Dec 04)Science and sailing are converging for the Sydney Hobart Yacht Race with oceanographers refining their satellite view of Australia’s eastern seaboard to track the ocean currents between Sydney and Hobart. Overview - Research   CSIRO research for a secure AustraliaCSIRO is addressing the security and counter-terrorism issues facing Australia with dedicated research and development programs to protect our country from terrorism, crime, invasive diseases and pests, and threats to our civil infrastructure and business community. Environmental informatics: strength in numbersMajor issues such as climate change, sustainable fisheries and urban water quality benefit from CSIRO's statistical and mathematical expertise. Our methods are being adopted and, in some cases, mandated by state and federal governments, and international agencies. Imaging for research, diagnostics and drug developmentOne of the key issues CSIRO is addressing is how to develop computer vision tools that, like the human eye, can recognise and discriminate between objects but are also able to make detailed, accurate measurements. Minerals Down Under: collaborative research in the minerals industryMinerals Down Under is a major new project for CSIRO. MDU is partnering industry, universities and others to coordinate targeted minerals industry research. MDU aims to place Australia’s minerals industry in a strategically commanding position in the global market.
