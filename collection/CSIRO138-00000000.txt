CSIRO Research engineer Dr Richard Helmer is standing ready to play the instrument superimposed on yellow background. The intent of this clip is to show the casual look of the instrument as well as the postural flexibility and ability to repeatedly play performance parts with the CSIRO wearable instrument shirt guitar. The wearable instrument shirt is a conventional black long sleeve T-shirt and the textile motion sensors used by the instrument for monitoring elbow movements and&#160;computer interface are not directly discernable in the garment. Dr Helmer performs&#160;eight quaver guitar chucks (four times chuck-down and chuck-up, percussive guitar sounds) to begin the rhythm guitar part of his original composition Guitar hero. &#8220;Developing the air guitar was a technical challenge for precision textile-based sensing.&#8221; Dr Richard Helmer Research engineer CSIRO Textile &amp; Fibre Technology He then plays the chorus pattern (E major, B major, D major, A major 8ve) once through standing facing the camera. The verse pattern (A major, E major, G major, D major) is then played once through and he includes some windmill guitar poses. The chorus is again played once through facing the camera in an enthusiastic style. The second verse has&#160;Dr Helmer&#160;playing the pattern twice. First, with guitar above and behind his head, followed by the guitar played off to the side. The chorus is played one last time and&#160;Dr Helmer&#160;finishes with an A major chord played with a point to the sky and&#160;two chucks to finish.
