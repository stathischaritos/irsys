Applying the Regional Development Futures Framework Key project outputs Applying the Regional Development Futures framework The Resource Futures Program (RFP) has recently completed the Catalyst Project &#8211; a two-year research partnership between the Central Coast community of NSW and CSIRO Sustainable Ecosystems. The study region incorporates the local government areas of Gosford and Wyong. The research provided an in-depth study of the complexities of managing change in a rapidly urbanising community close to two growing cities, Sydney and Newcastle, on the eastern seaboard of Australia. The research team used a systems approach to create a Regional Development Futures (RDF) framework to work with regions considering their future sustainability.&#160; This framework uses four stages: developing partnerships creating the foundation opportunities for change building resilient futures. The framework uses participatory approaches to combine local and scientific knowledge, and has also been used in the Augusta-Margaret River region of Western Australia and the Campbelltown-Camden&#160;region outside Sydney&#160;in NSW. The tools, processes, and scenarios developed will assist to inform and evaluate strategies and actions for business and government as well as those of other local organisations and groups. Key project outputs The key outputs of the project include: Public workshops and report More than 15 workshops were held with representatives from a diverse range of stakeholders including representatives from the project partners, youth, emergency services and community groups. These workshops focussed on issues important for regional sustainability as well as the cross linkages between these issues, for example transport. Surveys Five surveys of tourism businesses and activity, which are providing timely and ongoing monitoring of the tourism industry, which depends on the region's natural resources. Regional scale futures simulation model System dynamics modelling tools analysed contrasting scenario options for the future and can be used interactively use for scenario development. The Catalyst Futures forum provided a demonstration of how the model can be used to plan sustainable development pathways. Training workshops and training manual These were created to explain systems methods to analyse sustainability issues with local government, community and business people. Systems thinking workshops provided the process for scoping and framing sustainability issues and for identifying potential strategies. Subsequent research projects A subsequent project&#160;-&#160;Environmental Philanthropy: Options and Issues for Promoting Private conservation on the NSW Central Coast - has been funded by the federal&#160;Department of the Environment and Heritage and conducted by CSIRO and the Central Coast Community Environment Network.
