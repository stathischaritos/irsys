Advantages Sensor technology Outcomes Future applications Airborne magnetic surveys are an important part of mineral exploration, but those conducted with conventional total magnetic intensity (TMI) sensors present a limited, distorted and fuzzy view of geology, especially for strongly magnetic deposits. One way to achieve clarity is by measuring the rate of change of the magnetic field, known as gradiometry. Advantages CSIRO's GETMAG&#8482; system enables users to visualise the depth, size and shape of a deposit because it uses rotating magnetic gradiometers to take measurements about three separate axes. With GETMAG&#8482;, base stations and tie line levelling are no longer required and flight line spacings can be halved. GETMAG&#8482; should allow: construction of accurate, easy-to-interpret maps with multiple perspectives of geological sources better defined geology of features that are traditionally difficult to characterise greater interpretation of features to a depth of one kilometre accurate removal of noise from raw data. &#160; &#160; Magnetic maps of the same area made using CSIRO&#8217;s GETMAG&#8482; (left) shows details of depth and shape not revealed by a conventional TMI survey (right). Sensor technology The sensor at the heart of GETMAG&#8482; is a high temperature superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) operating in liquid nitrogen. SQUIDs are extremely sensitive, able to detect subtle variations in the strength of a magnetic field. Outcomes The GETMAG&#8482; prototype has been tested over a magnetite deposit in eastern Australia which has been thoroughly characterised through drilling and laboratory-based magnetic measurements. The magnetic gradient signal over most targets of interest is theoretically strong enough to detect from an aircraft. 'All determinable parameters of location, geometry and magnetization were found to accord with directly measured properties [and] only a few tensor gradiometer stations were needed to extract the same information as a whole total magnetic intensity survey.' (Exploration Geophysics) The prototype demonstrates the sensitivity of the device and what it can do, the next stage is to get it airborne. The magnetic gradient signal over most targets of interest is theoretically strong enough to detect from an aircraft equipped with GETMAG&#8482;. Future applications GETMAG&#8482; has ground-based applications such as surveying for unexploded ordnance, mine-site geophysics, and a miniaturised version could be used for down-hole mineral characterisation.
