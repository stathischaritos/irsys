 Return to normal viewCommonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research OrganisationComputer model of a hydro-cyclone flow.Fluid dynamics overviewA better understanding of how liquids and gases flow offers great potential for increasing the efficiency of processing technologies in a wide range of applications.Fluid dynamics is the science of understanding flowing materials.&#160; Water is, of course, a fluid, but there are many other applications of fluid dynamics in industry, the environment and even inside the human body. The air breathed into your lungs, the blood in your veins, wind and ocean currents, air streaming over an aeroplane wing and the hot gases in a car's combustion cylinder all obey the same fundamental fluid-dynamical equations.&#160; CSIRO work in the fluids area is investigating the creation of 3D models of tsunamis. Understanding fluid dynamics provides the background to develop new processing technologies and creates efficiencies in existing processes such as wear and noise reduction, higher throughput and more rapid processing. CSIRO work in this area is investigating: segregating materials on the basis of size, density or shape to improve processing in&#160;manufacturing, mining, and the food industry pipeline flows and blockages for the oil, gas and mining industries, including extracting solids from liquid streams processes for the pouring of molten metals, void removal in die-castings, and oxygen injection in steelmaking water flows in tanks, pipes and waterways injection-free epidermal drug delivery mixing highly viscous materials such as polymers, cements and food products air quality and temperature distribution creating 3D models of tsunamis animating fluids for movies and video games crushing, grinding, sampling, screening and transporting minerals Learn more about CSIRO's work in&#160;Manufacturing.
