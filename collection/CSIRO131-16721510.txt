This work won them a CSIRO Medal in 2004. Helping China re-vegetate the Loess PlateauA CSIRO developed tool is helping China's land and water resource managers rehabilitate an important water catchment and helping to secure China's environmental future. SedNet sediment network modeling softwareSedNet is a simple, testable, physically-based distribution model for catchment sediment transport which, by modeling sediment transport, can give healthier catchments and rivers. Underground communications system improves mine safetyCSIRO's new underground communications system provides timely and useful information for improved mine safety. Audio   Cold water eddy ‘monsters” mighty current off Sydney (Podcast 20 Mar 07)In this six-minute podcast Dr David Griffin, from the Wealth from Ocean's Flagship, explains how a huge dense eddy was the reason the sea was so cold off the coast of NSW this summer. DataTraceDNA takes up fight against fake art fraudsters (Podcast 2 Mar 07)Mr Greg Twemlow from DataTraceDNA explains how technology developed by CSIRO is tackling the problem of fake art in this six-minute podcast. Capability   Creating machines that sense and respondOur expertise combining intelligent sensors and computing leads to machines and products that can interact with their environment and alter the way they function. Driving improvements in oil and gas productionCSIRO delivers science solutions vital to a globally competitive and sustainable energy industry with a primary focus on oil, gas and geothermal energy resources. Exploring the new physics of the nanoscaleCSIRO’s large, integrated team of professional scientists and engineers research the new physics of the nanoscale. They cover biomimetics, nanoparticle films, biosensor arrays and molecular electronics. It's not rocket science... it's rockin' scienceWearable intelligent textiles, incorporating electronic circuitry and sensors, are well suited to become the basis of the next generation of control systems for many applications of mobile computing, allowing complete freedom of movement. Managing complex systemsCSIRO is applying systems and complexity theory to optimise the performance and efficiency of market areas such as manufacturing, mining, infrastructure, logistics and security. Predicting and reporting for natural resource managementCSIRO is leading the development of modelling technology for natural resource management in Australia and our prediction and reporting technologies will allow natural resource managers to model scenarios digitally and save millions of dollars. Understanding artificial intelligenceWith the development of advanced artificial intelligence technology, CSIRO scientists are taking automated systems process to a new level of capability. Utilising remote sensing dataCSIRO develops applications that make use of remote sensing data to help spot bushfires in remote areas, predict the weather and map land, vegetation and oceans. Fact Sheet   How Strontium Isotope Stratigraphy (SIS) worksStrontium Isotope Stratigraphy is used for high resolution chronostratigraphic control of sedimentary sequences. Sedsim technical details: subsurface processesSedsim software determines how sediments change in both time and space. This document explains how it works. Sedsim: the heart of itLearn here how Sedsim, software created by CSIRO that determines how sediments change in both time and space, works. Feature Article   CSIRAC: Australia’s first computerCSIRAC, built by CSIR in 1949, was the fourth computer in the world and the first to play digital music. Giving yachties a competitive edgeOceanographers are using satellite images to identify a range of features important in understanding the ocean around Australia – sea surface heights, water temperatures, current speed and direction. Maths to speed swimmersA virtual swimmer may give Australian athletes the edge in the 2012 Olympics. The Australian Synchrotron: a new bright light on scienceWhen the Australian Synchrotron opens in 2007, scientists will no longer have to travel overseas to carry out exciting materials research using atoms travelling at the speed of light. Media Release   Aussie ingenuity helps NASA search for new planets (Media release 23 Mar 05)CSIRO’s success with a new manufacturing technique for a piece of astrometry equipment is likely to help American scientists detect planets in our galaxy and beyond. Australia and China: Eyes in the sky to monitor climate change (Media release 1 Nov 06)CSIRO and the Chinese Academy of Surveying and Mapping (CASM) will sign a research agreement in Beijing today to collaborate on China’s resource mapping satellite program. CSIRO boasts Ig Nobel Laureates (Media release 6 Oct 06)The 2006 Ig Nobel Prize in mathematics was awarded to Dr Piers Barnes and Ms Nic Svenson of CSIRO for figuring out how many photographs to take of a group of people to be confident of getting at least one where no-one’s blinking. CSIRO builds smart farm (Media release 14 Sep 06)CSIRO is working towards the 'Smart Farm' of the future with research focussing on Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and their potential to transform the Australian agriculture industry.
