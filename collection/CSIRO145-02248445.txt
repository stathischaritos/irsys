Project summary Outcomes for industry Outcomes for research Project summary Allocating public funds for environmental programs requires that investment decisions are transparent and analytically sound. This project developed an index to measure the benefits arising from conservation projects in the Wet Tropics region of North Queensland. The Environmental Benefits Index (EBI) is designed for use in competitive tendering systems for environmental contracts. It can measure many different attributes simultaneously and so in a competitive tendering system it came be used to identify the best purchasing strategies for conservation contracts Regional natural resource management groups within the North Queensland region now have a framework for constructing an Environmental Benefits Index (EBI). This approach could be applied in other regions. Outcomes for industry Regional natural resource management groups within the North Queensland region now have a framework for constructing an environmental benefits index. Outcomes for research The Environmental Benefits Index (EBI) is based on multi-attribute utility theory (MAUT).&#160; This new research provides theory to assist development of internally consistent indices of environmental performance that are needed for utility measurement.
