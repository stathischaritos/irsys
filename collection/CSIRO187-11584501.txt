 Next: Checklist 1: How to Up: CAIN - Compact Array Previous: Restarting the integration clocks Contents Index Setting integration cycle parameters The following parameters define the Compact Array integration cycle. These are generally not for adjusting by the user, with the exception of cycle period, i.e., the length of a single integration cycle. This is typically set to 10 seconds and the observer uses the Averaging flag in SCHED to set it to longer values. For non-mosaicing observations, an averaging of 3 is strongly recommended. CAOBS cain cycle sets the cycle period to seconds, and CAOBS cain cycle default sets the cycle period to 10 seconds Robin Wark
