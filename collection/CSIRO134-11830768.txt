Sensing &amp; Sensor Networks  It's not rocket science... it's rockin' science Wearable intelligent textiles, incorporating electronic circuitry and sensors, are well suited to become the basis of the next generation of control systems for many applications of mobile computing, allowing complete freedom of movement.   What's NewCold water eddy ‘monsters” mighty current off Sydney (Podcast 20 Mar 07)Dr Andre Zerger: managing resources with spatial technologyCSIRO imagery shows outer Great Barrier Reef at risk from river plumes (Media release 22 Feb 07)Robotics student workshop (Northern Territory)More National Research FlagshipsFind out about the Flagship Program BusinessFind out about Doing Business Robotics student workshop (Northern Territory)It's not rocket science... it's rockin' scienceLocating bushfires as they happenPredicting and reporting for natural resource managementMore Watch &amp; ListenTitle: Cold water eddy ‘monsters” mighty current off Sydney (Podcast 20 Mar 07)Size: 5988 KB Site Map Using this Site Legal Notice and Disclaimer Privacy Copyright Last updated: 16 March 2007
