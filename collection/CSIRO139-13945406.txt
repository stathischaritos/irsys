Native vegetation Water-use efficiency Dryland salinity Soil acidity CSIRO is addressing a number of sustainability issues that face rural Australia including: declining areas of native vegetation&#160; water use efficiency dryland salinity soil acidity. Native vegetation Declining areas of native vegetation in the rural landscape can lead to salinity, reduced water quality and less biodiversity. CSIRO is identifying ways to conserve existing native vegetation on farms and establish new areas to help mitigate these problems. Water-use efficiency Wiser water use is of increasing importance with growing demands on existing water resources. CSIRO is investigating a variety of ways to enhance water-use efficiency and help to farmers implement water efficient practices on their farms, while still maintaining productivity. We are&#160;also&#160;assessing land capability and water resources in irrigated dairy regions. We&#160;then provide&#160;practical advice to the irrigation industry on the sustainable management of diminishing water resources. Our aim is to develop ways to determine best land and water use options that ensure maximum economic, environmental and social benefits. CSIRO aims to help farms remain productive and sustainable into the future. By developing systems for more effective use of existing land and water resources, CSIRO fosters greater productivity while minimising the environmental impact on Australia&#8217;s agricultural communities. Dryland salinity CSIRO is helping to address dryland salinity by: understanding its causes finding ways to minimise its spread&#160; restoring areas affected by it. In particular, CSIRO is improving water management practices to prevent dryland salinity through more suitable crop, pasture and native vegetation management. We are also developing plants that can cope with higher levels of salinity. By identifying sustainable grazing options, in particular shrubs, CSIRO also aims to provide out-of-season livestock feed&#160;in saline areas. This may improve profitability and biodiversity, and reduce salinity. CSIRO is also researching: effects of high-salt intakes on feed consumption diet selection foetal development product quality differences between livestock species. Soil acidity Soil acidity is a major problem costing over $A1 billion every year. CSIRO is recommending the application of lime and is also developing plants that can tolerate higher levels of acidity. In the low and medium rainfall regions of southern Australia we are looking at how shrubs can be used to stabilise soil and&#160;reduce soil acidification and salinity whilst maintaining livestock production.
