OPTIM™ Fine and OPTIM™ MaxOPTIM™ fibre treatment gives wool a silk like quality for extremely fine, soft and light weight fabrics. This unique technical development and innovation creates a wool fibre with a super light weight silky feel. QuickDry Merino: a new quick drying wool fabricCSIRO has produced a high performance ‘quick-dry’ finish for wool, to allow it to compete with the quick dry performance of synthetics and cotton in active sportwear markets Capability   Improving manufacturing systemsCSIRO is helping manufacturers compete globally by improving the flexibility and efficiency of their management, operations and manufacturing processes. Instrument and machine prototypingCSIRO's instrument and machine prototyping team combines with our engineering workshop to rapidly prototype and modify instruments for a range of projects and industry needs. It's not rocket science... it's rockin' scienceWearable intelligent textiles, incorporating electronic circuitry and sensors, are well suited to become the basis of the next generation of control systems for many applications of mobile computing, allowing complete freedom of movement. Measuring textile properties and tracking chemical residuesDemand for CSIRO’s pesticide residue testing service is expanding as woolgrowers and brokers prepare for tougher environmental requirements in Europe. Nonwoven textile research facilities at Geelong, VictoriaCSIRO’s modern nonwoven production mill produces small samples, and also allows product development on pilot scale equipment. Fibre bonding is achieved by chemical or heat treatment, needlepunch or hydroentanglement. Prototype engineering workshopCSIRO's experience with toolmaking and fine machining enables us to customize tooling and manual programming to suit the most complex needs. Textile processing for every stage of productionBusinesses large and small, Australian and overseas, routinely use CSIRO's fibre and textile processing facilities for small batches that require custom processing conditions.
