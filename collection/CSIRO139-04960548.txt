Patients wore devices which provided data to medical professionals to alert them to an adverse event, such as a fall or heart arrhythmia, occurring. The study aimed to detect not just falls but also vital signs, such as heart rate, that may act as precursors to adverse events. Queensland Health Minister, Gordon Nuttall, says the device has the ability to provide medical professionals with immediate quality information for early detection of medical problems. &#8220;We hope that this device may soon help patients to remain in their comfortable home surroundings, while remaining under expert medical surveillance,&#8221; Mr Nuttall says. CEO of the e-Health Research Centre, Gary Morgan, says the Centre is researching and testing the use of personal monitoring technologies in clinical settings with the objective of extending them to community health facilities or to the home. &#8220;The patient can continue their normal stroke rehabilitation and daily activities with improved levels of confidence through this monitoring research.&#8221; Dr Gary Morgan, CEO of e-Health Research Centre &#8220;In the future, it would be desirable in an emergency for a real-time software system to alert not only the physicians, but the patient and their family, carers or emergency services,&#8221;&#160; Mr Morgan says. &#8220;The patient can continue their normal stroke rehabilitation and daily activities with improved levels of confidence through this monitoring research.&#8221; Established in 2003, the e-Health Research Centre is a national research facility in Information and Communications Technology (ICT) for healthcare applications. A $15 million joint venture between CSIRO and the Queensland Government, the Centre is the largest single-funded e-health research and development facility in the southern hemisphere, and comprises a multi-disciplinary team of world-renowned researchers dedicated to excellence in research and health services.
