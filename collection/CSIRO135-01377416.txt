Profile - Person   Dr David Evans: probing the fundamental science of woolBetter understanding of the chemistry and surface properties of wool fibres can form the basis of new processing treatments and product properties. Dr Geoff Naylor: from prickle science to fine cottonDr Geoff Naylor helped develop prickle-free wool jumpers and warm wool doonas. Now his team is developing an instrument to measure cotton quality. Dr Ian Russell: A chemist in the service of woolWith the direction of organic chemist Dr Ian Russell, CSIRO has developed unique expertise in the measurement of pesticides on wool, in wool processing effluents and in the environment. Dr Louis Kyratzis: repairing and regenerating tissues on textile scaffoldsCSIRO researchers are working on textile structures that can form foundation structures for promoting the repair or regeneration of nerves, skin, and spinal discs. Dr Niall Finn: from fusion to fibre function, fashion and beyondDr Finn's research on advanced fibrous materials makes use of a bi-component synthetic fibre extruder, which produces filaments containing two polymers chosen for their complementary properties. Dr Richard Helmer: engineering next generation intelligent textilesThe virtual air guitar showcases CSIRO’s expertise in the design and manufacture of intelligent, electronic textiles for controlling computers and adding functionality to many products. Dr Ron Denning: chemist who gives wool an edgeTwo new CSIRO technologies that improve the convenience and comfort of wool clothing could soon be in a store near you: QuickDry Merino which has the drying time of polyester and Active-wear Merino fabric which feels drier and cooler during exercise. Dr Sally Hutchinson: drawn by chemistry’s power to explainIn her research on medical textiles, Dr Sally Hutchinson has devised a method that gives a visual indication to patients and health care professionals on the level of pathogenic bacteria present, and hence the health of the wound. Dr Sharon Edwards: using textiles to support and guide tissue growthA post-doctoral scientist at CSIRO’s textile laboratory in Geelong, Dr Edwards is investigating medical applications of textiles — in particular, the use of textiles to support cell growth and tissue regeneration, healing damaged tissues, such as nerves. Dr Shaun Smith: promoting technology transfer in the textile industryAs CSIRO’s Client Relationship Manager for Australian Wool Innovation Ltd, Dr Shaun Smith is responsible for day-to-day interactions between the two organisations.
