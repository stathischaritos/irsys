Creating water smart city systemsBy assessing the environmental, social and economic consequences of alternative water systems the Water for a Healthy Country Flagship is developing tools that will help create water smart cities for the future. Dynamic habitat of the Coorong, Lower Lakes and Murray Mouth (CLLAMM)The Water for a Healthy Country Flagship will deliver dynamic habitat maps and models that can be used to investigate the effects of river flows on key plant and animal species in the Coorong, Lower Lakes and Murray Mouth (CLLAMM) region of South Australia. Farm Water FuturesThe Water for a Healthy Country Flagship is developing and demonstrating processes to help farmers make operational decisions that reduce the impact of salinity and waterlogging on their farms and the environment.   Great Barrier Reef floodplain renewalThe Water for a Healthy Country Flagship is helping to change floodplain land management to improve the quality of water entering the Great Barrier Reef. The program is focused on maximising productivity and ecosystem sustainability across a range of industries reliant on the floodplain. Great Barrier Reef sustainable grazingWater for a Healthy Country Flagship researchers are working with grazing communities to develop new land-management practices that will help protect the Great Barrier Reef from excess sediment and nutrient deposits from catchments. Increasing irrigation efficiency across the Murray RegionFlagship research in the Murray region is showing that big water savings are possible while maintaining existing crops and reducing negative environmental impacts. Integrated land and water planning in the MalleeThe Water for a Healthy Country Flagship is addressing environmental, economic and social issues in the Mallee region of south-eastern Australia. The outcome will be security of irrigation development while protecting the environment. Integrated livestock business systemsCSIRO is working to incorporate social and economic factors into livestock business systems. Our projects include weighing sheep remotely and monitoring pastures from space. &#160;Key species responses to water managementThe Water for a Healthy Country Flagship will map the responses of key species to changes in aquatic environments and water management regimes in the Coorong, Lower Lakes and Murray mouth. Livestock for a sustainable environmentCSIRO scientists are tackling issues such as salinity, soil acidity, erosion, herbicide resistance and climate change through a range of integrated research activities using livestock. Making best use of environmental water in the Murray ValleyThe Water for a Healthy Country Flagship is assessing how key drivers, such as the timing, duration and quality of water flows, influence the ecological health of the Murray River, its wetlands and its floodplains. Optimising River Murray Uplands resourcesThe Water for a Healthy Country Flagship is working in the agriculturally important River Murray Uplands to find the best solutions for maximising agricultural profitability and sustainability while reducing salinisation and protecting the environment. Perth water systemsThe Water for a Healthy Country Flagship is analysing Perth’s water resources to support improved management. Reef Catchment FuturesFlagship research will produce tools that enable the integrated exploration of how grazing and floodplain management decisions impact on the Great Barrier Reef region. Revegetation strategies: new ways to deliver environmental servicesThe Water for a Healthy Country Flagship is addressing the serious environmental problems resulting from land clearing by developing cost-effective revegetation strategies to improve environmental health and increase agricultural productivity. Rural town water managementWater for a Healthy Country research is addressing problems facing country towns in the wheatbelt area of Western Australia such as salinity, waterlogging and declining populations. South-West water futuresCSIRO research is determining options for land and water resource use in the south-west irrigation district of Western Australia that ensure the highest economic return and minimal environmental and social impacts. Sustaining food webs within the Coorong, Lower Lakes and Murray Mouth (CLLAMM) regionThe Water for a Healthy Country Flagship will deliver food-webs and models that can be used to investigate the effects of river flows on the production and use of organic matter at the ecosystem level in the Coorong, Lower Lakes and Murray Mouth region. Sustaining the environmental health of the lower MurrayThe Water for a Healthy Country Flagship is developing tools to evaluate management options for the economically and environmentally important Coorong, Lower Lakes and Murray Mouth (CLLAMM) region in South Australia. Swan FuturesThe Water for a Healthy Country Flagship is facilitating the development of a Regional Water Management Strategy for urban environments, integrating environmental, social and economic challenges in water resource management and domestic water supply. The Australian Water Availability ProjectWater availability across Australia is being mapped in research that will help farmers and water managers prepare for drought, and use natural resources both productively and sustainably. The future of the Coorong, Lower Lakes and Murray Mouth (CLLAMM)The Water for a Healthy Country Flagship will provide a window on alternate futures of the Coorong, Lower Lakes and Murray Mouth (CLLAMM) region, with models informed by research into key species, food webs and habitat. The role of volunteers in natural resource managementCSIRO has embarked on a five-year project which aims to establish a long term vision of values and goals for Natural Resource Management in Australia in a future that will face increasing environmental challenges. Water benefits from the River Murray regionThe Water for a Healthy Country Flagship is working to increase the net benefits derived from using water in the River Murray region.
