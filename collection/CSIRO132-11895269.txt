This new resource will enable our biomedical research team to experiment with tissue engineering from textile structures. CCI small sample weaving machine (video)A 30-second video showing the slow and gentle operation of the CCI sample weaving machine which enables CSIRO to rapidly produce small samples of customised fabric from a diverse new range of fibres. Award-winning carbon nanotube (video)This two-and-a-half-minute video discusses the work of Mr Ken Atkinson and his team from CSIRO Textile &amp; Fibre Technology for their work on dry-formed carbon nanotube structures for advanced textiles which won the team a 2006 CSIRO Medal for Research Achievement. Playing the air guitar (Podcast 13 Nov 06)Dr Richard Helmer talks about a shirt that lets the user play real music on an air guitar in this five-minute podcast. Wearable guitar instrument shirt interview (video)This one-minute video interviews Dr Richard Helmer about CSIRO's wearable instrument shirt guitar, which works by recognising and interpreting arm movements and relaying this wirelessly to a computer for audio generation, and then shows him demonstrating the shirt with a backing track. Wearable instrument shirt: guitar (Video)This 48-second video shows CSIRO's wearable instrument shirt guitar, a conventional black long sleeve T-shirt, which works by textile motion sensors being used by the instrument for monitoring elbow movements and making the necessary computer interface while not directly discernable in the garment. Wearable instrument shirt: guiro (video)An 11-second video demonstrating the wearable instrument shirt playing a simple moderately paced rhythm with occasional accents that simulate a guiro being stroked slowly upward and struck downward quickly. Wearable instrument shirt: tambourine (video)This 21-second video shows scientists demonstrating the wearable instrument shirt playing as a simple moderately paced tambourine rhythm with occasional accents that simulate a tambourine being shaken as well as tapped for accent. Wool, fibre of the gods (video)This three-and-a-half-minute video animation, produced by CSIRO, looks at the various elements of the wool fibre and the properties that each part contributes to wool's usefulness.
