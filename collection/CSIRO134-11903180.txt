Featured article Robust Outdoor Vision-based Experimental Robots The Robust Outdoor Vision-based Experimental Robots (ROVER) project is looking to develop autonomous outdoor ground vehicles for civilian applications. Featured article Lego Robotics student workshop (South Queensland) Robots are becoming more and more common in our daily lives. Experiment with your own robot in the Lego Robotics workshopfor Years 2 - 12, run by CSIRO Education in South Queensland.   Capability   Creating machines that sense and respondOur expertise combining intelligent sensors and computing leads to machines and products that can interact with their environment and alter the way they function. Developing technologies which can gather information, learn and adaptCSIRO researchers are developing technologies which can gather information, learn and adapt, then use that information to generate intelligent, goal-directed behaviour – all without human intervention. Giving machines visionCSIRO’s Machine Vision team is expanding the capabilities of visioning hardware-software, building machines able to automatically process images in real-world conditions. Improving manufacturing systemsCSIRO is helping manufacturers compete globally by improving the flexibility and efficiency of their management, operations and manufacturing processes. Managing complex systemsCSIRO is applying systems and complexity theory to optimise the performance and efficiency of market areas such as manufacturing, mining, infrastructure, logistics and security. Understanding artificial intelligenceWith the development of advanced artificial intelligence technology, CSIRO scientists are taking automated systems process to a new level of capability. Utilising remote sensing dataCSIRO develops applications that make use of remote sensing data to help spot bushfires in remote areas, predict the weather and map land, vegetation and oceans. Media Release   CSIRO Robotic Submarine wins Australian Engineering Excellence Award (Media release 29 Nov 06)An innovative robotic submarine from CSIRO is set to transform environmental monitoring by dramatically reducing the cost of data collection. CSIRO and University of Tasmania build technology strength for Tasmania (Media release 13 Feb 07)CSIRO and the University of Tasmania today signed a significant agreement to develop the research leaders of tomorrow. CSIRO builds smart farm (Media release 14 Sep 06)CSIRO is working towards the 'Smart Farm' of the future with research focussing on Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and their potential to transform the Australian agriculture industry.
