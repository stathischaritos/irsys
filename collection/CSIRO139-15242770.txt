Research themes Staff Facilities CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research (CMAR) aims to advance Australian climate, marine and earth systems science. Our research focusses on issues affecting Australia and the world, and we provide a range of scientific and consulting services that are underpinned by this research. Australia is the custodian of one of the largest marine jurisdictions in the world, an area more than twice that of our land mass. An enormous range of economic and recreational opportunities exist, while the oceans around Australia play a major role in controlling world and regional climate. The atmospheric composition of the Southern Hemisphere and the exchange of gases with the land and sea are important in measuring, modelling and analysing climate change and ozone depletion. Research themes CMAR&#8217;s research effort&#160;has four major themes, each comprised of several research streams. The&#160; Climate, Weather and Ocean Prediction theme develops Earth system models and knowledge of climate processes to make climate and ocean predictions and assess climate change impacts. It aims to help our climate-sensitive society make better decisions. Researchers in the&#160;Living Atmosphere theme&#160;use observations of the atmosphere and Earth to assess air quality, greenhouse gases and the interactions between land and air. Their work focuses on policies, actions and methodologies that are responsive to changes in atmospheric health, for the responsible use of the atmosphere and its interactions with the Earth. The Marine Ecosystems and Resources themeaim is to balance the use and conservation of Australia's marine resources and the ecosystems that support them. Researchers in this theme investigate: aquaculture and biotechnology northern and pelagic fisheries and ecosystems ensures sustainable management of fisheries. The&#160;Integrated Coastal and Oceans Management theme&#160;investigates Australia's coastal and ocean marine ecosystems and biodiversity for its sustainable development, use, enjoyment and conservation. The work investigates: ecosystem-based management of multiple ocean uses assesses marine biodiversity explores Eastern and Western Australian coasts. Staff CMAR comprises about 550 staff, plus more than 150 students, Fellows, and long-term visitors. Staff are located at sites in five states: Australia&#8217;s large marine jurisdiction offers an enormous range of economic and recreational opportunities, while playing a major role in controlling climate. Aspendale, Victoria Canberra, ACT Cleveland, Queensland Floreat, Western Australia Hobart, Tasmania. The headquarters are located in the Hobart offices. Facilities CMAR also manages: the Marine National Facility &#8211; Research Vessel Southern Surveyor a number of marine and atmospheric collections the CSIRO Office of Space Science and Applications.
