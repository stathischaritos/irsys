CSIRO runs an interactive robotics program for students in Years 3-6 in the Northern Territory . It's not rocket science... it's rockin' scienceWearable intelligent textiles, incorporating electronic circuitry and sensors, are well suited to become the basis of the next generation of control systems for many applications of mobile computing, allowing complete freedom of movement. Locating bushfires as they happenSentinel Hotspots provides reliable 'eyes' in the sky for Emergency Services, using satellite images to locate and map bushfires occurring in Australia and providing the information to anyone on the internet. Predicting and reporting for natural resource managementCSIRO is leading the development of modelling technology for natural resource management in Australia and our prediction and reporting technologies will allow natural resource managers to model scenarios digitally and save millions of dollars. Exploring the new physics of the nanoscaleCSIRO’s large, integrated team of professional scientists and engineers research the new physics of the nanoscale. They cover biomimetics, nanoparticle films, biosensor arrays and molecular electronics. Putting remote sensing on the mapCSIRO and the Australian Greenhouse Office have developed remote sensing tools and technologies that allow Australia to accurately measure land cover change over the past 30 years. Safe-T-Cam: keeping an eye on the roadCSIRO-developed automated imaging technology is finding many uses, including helping traffic authorities monitor heavy vehicles on the highway. Understanding artificial intelligenceWith the development of advanced artificial intelligence technology, CSIRO scientists are taking automated systems process to a new level of capability. Automated detection of road cracksCSIRO’s automated road sensing system, RoadCrack, is able to find cracks in road paving down to a width of one millimetre at high speeds, reducing the cost and increasing the accuracy of road crack detection.   Utilising remote sensing dataCSIRO develops applications that make use of remote sensing data to help spot bushfires in remote areas, predict the weather and map land, vegetation and oceans. Managing complex systemsCSIRO is applying systems and complexity theory to optimise the performance and efficiency of market areas such as manufacturing, mining, infrastructure, logistics and security. Creating machines that sense and respondOur expertise combining intelligent sensors and computing leads to machines and products that can interact with their environment and alter the way they function.
