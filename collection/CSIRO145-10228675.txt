The capability How CSIRO uses it Who else is involved The capability Autonomous systems have the potential to bring enormous sociological and economic benefits through: improved human safety increased equipment utilisation reduced maintenance costs increased production. CSIRO&#8217;s conducts research in the areas of robotics and intelligent systems, with a further specialty in biomedical imaging technologies. CSIRO researchers are developing autonomous systems which can gather information, learn and adapt, then use that information to generate intelligent, goal-directed behaviour. The Intelligent Systems team&#8217;s skill set includes: multi-component complex systems machine learning embedded networks&#160; distributed intelligence emergent behaviour. The Robotics team brings together a broad range of skills for robotic applications, with a history in: machine vision &#8211; both image and laser automation and robotic control systems engineering &#8211; mechanical, electrical, electronics and software engineering wireless sensor and actuator networks. How CSIRO uses it Intelligent systems research focuses on distributed, intelligent sensing systems and the sensing and/or communicating of information. We are developing new technologies and research for a future generation of information and security systems. These systems can interact between component parts which allow the emergence of global behaviour that would not be anticipated from the behaviour of the components in isolation. Application areas range from robust communication networks and engineering systems (for example, our&#160;Ageless Aerospace vehicle) to intelligent, sustainable agriculture. The key technical challenge being addressed by the CSIRO ICT Centre&#8217;s Robotics team is how to build robotic systems that behave intelligently and can navigate in real-world environments. Our research program is focused on civil applications, including: municipal operations construction mining forestry environmental monitoring remediation and agriculture. Who else is involved CSIRO&#8217;s autonomous systems researchers work closely with both local and international collaborators, including: NASA MIT &#8211; Computer Science and AI Laboratory University of Southern California &#8211; Robotic Embedded Systems Laboratory Orica Comalco Australian Coal Association Research Program (ACARP).
