 ASSET DETAIL TitlePond Aerators in a Prawn Farm CaptionPond aerators at a Queensland prawn farm. Australian prawn farms have the potential to be world leaders in production, disease management and environmental sustainability, thanks to research efforts by scientists and industry. CSIRO Marine Research has helped to develop domestication strategies for farmed prawn species which reduce reliance on diminishing wild prawn stocks and give farmers greater control over when they stock. Other research is focused on genetic enhancement, disease control and reducing the environmental impact of prawn farming. Picture credit: Lin Martin/CSIRO Marine Research.
