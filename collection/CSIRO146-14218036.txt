About Science on Saturday&#160; Details About Science on Saturday Science on Saturday is a fun and exciting Queensland Government program through which Queensland school students from seven to 14 years have an opportunity to participate in real hands-on science experiments on topics including: Toy science. They move, they do things and are a lot of fun, but how are they designed? Look at some toys from a designer's view. What do you add, what do you take off and what is the best design to use? Each phase will run for six weeks in venues across Queensland, with a new topic each week. Come to one or come to all. Construction science. A session to look at why structures are built the way they are. Why do bridges stay up? What shape&#160;is strongest? Test different structures and find out. Food chemistry. Food will never be the same again! Investigate the chemistry of food and put your brain to the test with our muddle puzzles. Science in Space. What do astronauts eat? Can humans live on Mars? Answer these questions and more as you explore the Earth and beyond. Slime time. It&#8217;s slimy. It&#8217;s disgusting! Make different slimes to take home. Be prepared to get messy! Weather scientists. Work as a meteorologist, learn about weather patterns by taking some measurements and make some of your own weather measuring instruments. Each phase will run for six weeks in venues across Queensland, with a new topic each week.&#160;Attend one program or attend all of them. Four phases will run over the year, so if you can't find a Science on Saturday session in your town during term 1, don't worry, we might come to a venue near you later in the year! Most sessions include something to take home. Children&#160;who attend all six sessions&#160;will receive&#160;one of&#160;the following&#160;magazines at the end of their program: The Helix: a science magazine for ages 10+ Scientriffic: a science magazine for ages 7+. Science on Saturday is an initiative of the Queensland Government and delivered by CSIRO Education. Details Science on Saturday usually costs A$6 per session (pre-paid) or A$7 per session if you pay on the day, but for&#160;Phase 1 ONLY&#160;there is a&#160;special flat&#160;price of A$6 per session!
