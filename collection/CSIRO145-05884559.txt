Fibrous materials characterisation Our areas of expertise Our facilities What we provide and interpret How we use electron microscopy for fibrous materials characterisation New scanning electron microscope Outputs CSIRO&#8217;s material characterisation expertise helps improve product performance and resilience across a range of product types and operating conditions. Materials characterisation is the detailed study of a material&#8217;s structure and performance. It helps us to understand the nature or origins of a material and how to improve its performance and usability. Fibrous materials characterisation CSIRO Textile&#160;&amp; Fibre Technology can examine the features, composition, structure, and defects of fibrous materials. This information can be used to: identify new uses for existing materials create new materials improve material processing and manufacturing techniques. We use modern electron and optical microscopy to study materials where the problem is invisible to the naked eye. Our highly skilled microscopy unit uses state of the art microscopes both electron and optical with imaging and analysis facilities to solve a vast range of problems. Our areas of expertise Our areas of expertise include: structure and properties of textile fibres and hair optical microscopy Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analytical microscopy Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) analytical microscopy fibre chemistry and fibre physics characterisation of fibre surface structure evaluation of surface treatments identification and analysis of surface coatings, plasticisers and similar additives chemical spectroscopy, chemical, thermal and mechanical analysis analysis applied to textile problems the bonding of polymers to the surface of natural fibres identification of materials and contaminants monitoring effects of chemical and physical treatments on fibre properties testing of physical fabric properties. Our facilities The facilities at Textile &amp; Fibre Technology include: Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) Backscattered Electron Imaging (BSI) Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDXS) Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (EELS) Optical Microscopy (OM) Scanned Probe Microscopy (SPM) Microtomes and Ultramicrotomes Hohenstein skin model (thermal and vapour resistance, total heat loss). What we&#160;provide and interpret We can provide and interpret: low to high magnification images elemental and compound analyses chemical and mechanical treatments wettability measurements surface roughness and topographic profiles surface friction maps plasma-etched/modified surfaces image analysis/particle size distributions identification of contaminants tensile properties under controlled conditions polymer cross-link density and crystallinity micro-mechanical properties thermal properties&#160; colloidal particle size and charge. How we use electron microscopy for fibrous materials characterisation One of the critical aspects of materials characterisation is to be able to visualise the external and sometimes internal structure of the sample.&#160; Electron microscopes (EM) allow this visualisation to occur at very high resolution.&#160; EM is primarily divided into two separate techniques: Scanning EM (SEM) Transmission EM (TEM).&#160; With both of these techniques, not only can the structure of the sample be imaged, compositional and crystallographic information can be determined as well. New scanning electron microscope The division is about to take delivery of a new scanning electron microscope with a resolution of&#160;1.5 nm. Outputs We provide&#160;high quality output on glossy or high quality paper for internal and external clients, as well as electronic output in TIFF or JPEG format.&#160; Print&#160;our&#160;Microscopy information sheet. &#160;&#160; Fast facts Electron microscopes are used to provide high quality images at very high magnifications The highest useable magnification available with normal optical microscopes is around 1 000 times The maximum magnification on our scanning electron microscope is 300 000 times The maximum on the transmission electron microscope is 1 200 000 times Most of the images are taken between 1 000 and 100 000 times magnification Our new Scanning Electron Microscope has a&#160;resolution of 3 000 x 2 500 pixels Primary Contact Mr Colin VeitchElectron MicroscopistCSIRO Textile &amp; Fibre TechnologyPhone: 61 3 5246 4891 Fax: 61 3 5246 4057 Email: Colin.Veitch&#64;csiro.auLocation Textile &amp; Fibre Technology - BelmontColac RoadBelmont VIC 3216AustraliaTechnology Geelong LaboratoriesPO Box 21Belmont VIC 3216AustraliaRelated Areas Materials Characterisation &amp; Performance Textiles Microscopy CSIRO Textile &amp; Fibre Technology Related Topics Textile testing laboratory Measuring textile properties and tracking chemical residues Textile processing and manufacturing services &#160;/csiro/content/standard/ps2fo.html/science/ps2fo.html/content/ps2fo.html Site Map Using this Site Legal Notice and Disclaimer Privacy Copyright Last updated: 7 November 2006
