Policy for the future Likely impact of the theme Current projects&#160; Sustainable development, based on Australia&#8217;s huge marine and coastal ecosystems, is a major opportunity for the coming decades. Most Australians live on the coast and marine industries are among the fastest growing sectors of our economy. The Wealth from Oceans Flagship is undertaking significant research to help develop Australia's ocean-based industries. The research program aims to deliver multiple management options for sustainable development of Australia&#8217;s marine regions by 2013. Achieving sustainable economic and social benefits from this development will require a new approach to ocean management and the science that guides it. Policy for the future Through Australia&#8217;s Oceans Policy, the Commonwealth Government and most State governments have established initiatives to address this need. The new approach takes a system view of the multiple human uses of ocean ecosystems and their management. It recognises that the requirements of sustainable, multiple-use may be different from those for any use in isolation. In addition, that the biophysical and human systems are closely coupled, so both need to be considered in any solution. This research area provides the science necessary to develop this new approach. The research will develop solutions and programs that can then be implemented through close linkages to policy makers and management authorities. Wealth from Oceans research takes a system view of the multiple human uses of ocean ecosystems and their management. The three principle areas of research are: understanding ecosystems and integrated ocean management key national issues relating to regional marine planning multiple use management for key regional ecosystems. Likely impact of the theme The impact of this research is robust, sustainable development of coastal and ocean ecosystems. Aligned to the sustainable outcomes are social, economic and ecological benefits that flow from this whole of system approach. Such benefits include: improved and more transparent incorporation of environmental, economic and social values and issues in regional planning and decision-making cost-effective monitoring and observation programs to support regional planning, regional management and state of environment reporting sustainable industries and economic development with more efficient and transparent processes for environmental assessment and approvals avoiding the need for economically and socially costly remediation of local ecosystems of the type now necessary in terrestrial ecosystems a system of marine protected areas, and integrated off-reserve management strategies, to safeguard marine biodiversity and ecosystem processes. The research brings together, from both inside and outside CSIRO, the widely differing science disciplines needed to develop new scientific methods, models, observations and analysis for multiple-use management.&#160; Case studies will be used to focus on the most relevant issues to &#8216;ground-test&#8217; the scientific methods and predictions and to facilitate uptake of the science. The research establishes an iterative &#8216;learning loop&#8217; between these two elements to successively develop, test and refine new science and management solutions. Current projects Research&#160;projects in this area include: Researching healthier marine ecosystemsCSIRO research will provide fisheries, aquatic industries and recreational marine users with access to healthy and productive regional marine ecosystems. Research spotlight turns on Ningaloo region Growing coastal populations and tourism present a range of challenges for management of coastal resources.
