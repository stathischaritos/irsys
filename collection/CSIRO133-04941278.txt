Cotton field to fabric training courseA three-day event held at CSIRO Textile and Fibre Technology for participants in all sectors of the cotton pipeline from agronomy to post-farm sectors including ginning, classing, yarn formation and quality control.  Cotton field to fabric training course program and registration formThis three-page flyer details Cotton Field to Fabric training program to be held at CSIRO Textile and Fibre Technology in July 2007. Young scientist wins award for excellence in wool scienceDr Sally Hutchinson of CSIRO takes the top AWI/DWI award for Excellence in Wool Science for her innovative work across a range of project in fundamental wool science. Dr Niall Finn: from fusion to fibre function, fashion and beyondDr Finn's research on advanced fibrous materials makes use of a bi-component synthetic fibre extruder, which produces filaments containing two polymers chosen for their complementary properties. Webscanner information sheetCSIRO has developed the Webscanner, a high-resolution quality monitor for continuously recording web uniformity, within pre-set card parameters, in non-woven textiles. Textiles as templates for tissue growthCSIRO scientists are using textile support structures as templates for the growth of new tissues for use in maintaining, restoring or improving the function of damaged tissues and organs. Farming Ahead: CSIRO and related articles from 2007Farming Ahead magazine regularly features CSIRO and related research for the agricultural sector. This is a list of articles published in the magazine throughout 2007. Microscopy information sheetA five-page information sheet addressing how modern electron and optical microscopy is used to study materials where the problem is invisible to the naked eye. CSIRO's fibre analysis microscopy unit uses state-of-the-art electron and optictial microscopes with imaging and analytical techniques to solve a vast range of problems. Dr Louis Kyratzis: repairing and regenerating tissues on textile scaffoldsCSIRO researchers are working on textile structures that can form foundation structures for promoting the repair or regeneration of nerves, skin, and spinal discs. CCI small sample weaving machine (video)A 30-second video showing the slow and gentle operation of the CCI sample weaving machine which enables CSIRO to rapidly produce small samples of customised fabric from a diverse new range of fibres. Dr Sharon Edwards: using textiles to support and guide tissue growthA post-doctoral scientist at CSIRO’s textile laboratory in Geelong, Dr Edwards is investigating medical applications of textiles — in particular, the use of textiles to support cell growth and tissue regeneration, healing damaged tissues, such as nerves. Harry Lucas R-1s circular knitting machine (video)A 30-second video showing CSIRO's recently installed new circular knitting machine for constructing miniature hollow tubes. This new resource will enable our biomedical research team to experiment with tissue engineering from textile structures. Dr Ron Denning: chemist who gives wool an edgeTwo new CSIRO technologies that improve the convenience and comfort of wool clothing could soon be in a store near you: QuickDry Merino which has the drying time of polyester and Active-wear Merino fabric which feels drier and cooler during exercise. Mr Robin Cranston: a researcher who pressed buttons at an Italian tanneryCSIRO is developing textile arm and leg sleeves for preventing skin tears in the elderly and bed-ridden. Nearly 15 per cent of people in high-care nursing homes have a skin tear at any one time, according to research at the Victorian College of Pharmacy. Shade-cloth keeps water storages cleanerCSIRO scientists have trialled shade-cloth covers for water storage basins in East Gippsland, in conjunction with the water authority and a shade cloth manufacturer. Shade cloths improved water quality and reduced evaporation losses. QuickDry Merino: technical production manualAn 11-page QuickDry Merino technical production manual which details how fine merino wool is prepared and treated with a water resistent finish to reduce its drying time by a factor of three for machine wash wool.  Award-winning carbon nanotube (video)This two-and-a-half-minute video discusses the work of Mr Ken Atkinson and his team from CSIRO Textile &amp; Fibre Technology for their work on dry-formed carbon nanotube structures for advanced textiles which won the team a 2006 CSIRO Medal for Research Achievement. ‘Service to Industry Award’ to textile division Chief (Media release 7 Dec 06)CSIRO Textile and Fibre Technology’s Chief, Dr Nigel Johnson, has been presented with a ‘Service to Industry Award’ for his long-term commitment to the textile industry. Dr Richard Helmer: engineering next generation intelligent textilesThe virtual air guitar showcases CSIRO’s expertise in the design and manufacture of intelligent, electronic textiles for controlling computers and adding functionality to many products. Nonwoven textile research facilities at Geelong, VictoriaCSIRO’s modern nonwoven production mill produces small samples, and also allows product development on pilot scale equipment. Fibre bonding is achieved by chemical or heat treatment, needlepunch or hydroentanglement. Textile News Online: Issue 15The 12-page newsletter Textile News Online (TNO) provides news on developments in biofibrous materials and advanced fibrous materials research and technologies from CSIRO's division of Textile and Fibre Technology. Industry benefits from technical textile research facilitiesCSIRO’s technical textile production capabilities include traditional knitting and weaving, three-dimensional knitting, and modern machinery for nonwoven bonding by chemical, heat or mechanical processes. Insulin receptor researchers win top CSIRO award (Media release 15 Nov 06)A team of scientists who determined the molecular structure of the insulin receptor – the protein on the surface of cells that mediates the effects of insulin – has won the 2006 CSIRO Chairman’s Medal. Carbon nanotube team tops off a big year (Media release 15 Nov 06)CSIRO Textile and Fibre Technology’s Carbon Nanotubes Research Team has topped off a year of major achievement with the award last night of a CSIRO Research Medal.
