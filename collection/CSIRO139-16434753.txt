CSIRO is currently focusing on ICT that creates and supports: better environmental monitoring and management more efficient use of energy smarter and more efficient healthcare improved agricultural production security and safety for people. CSIRO has the ability to innovate in ICT through its thorough understanding of the needs and problems of Australian industries. Australia has significant expertise in areas such as wireless communications and robotics. In certain core areas of ICT, such as wireless communications and robotics, Australia is globally competitive. CSIRO focuses its ICT research where our work has potential to lead to globally adopted solutions. Since the development of CSIRAC in 1949, Australia&#8217;s first recordable computer, through to recent developments in enterprise search engines and data-mining software, we have been at the forefront of ICT.
