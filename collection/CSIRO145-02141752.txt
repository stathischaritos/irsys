The challenge&#160; What CSIRO did Outcomes The challenge Palau is renowned for its pristine natural environment which supports tourism, fishing and other extractive industries, as well as a resident population. Crucial to ensuring the ongoing quality of Palau&#8217;s natural environment is effective management of solid waste. What CSIRO did In 2005 an economic study by CSIRO estimated that Pacific Island community of Palau potentially could avoid costs of US$2 million per year by reducing or preventing solid waste pollution across the island. Typical solid waste materials in Palau include: paper metals organic matter soil, putrescible green matter (grass, leaves and wood) glass ceramics textiles rubber car/truck bodies and batteries. These materials can be considered pollution because they are damaging (albeit to varying extents) to the natural environment and, thereby, to human wellbeing. The most significant costs to the community of Palau include lost tourism, costs of water-related illness, public dumpsite management and loss of near shore fisheries. The most significant costs of this type of pollution in Palau were found to be through: lost tourism (US$1 million) healthcare and illness (US$700 000) public waste collection and dumpsite operation (US$100 000) loss of near shore fish catch (US$90 000). These estimates are opportunity costs, that is, money that could be spent on other goods and services if it weren&#8217;t tied up in pollution management. Although these costs can&#8217;t be eliminated entirely, the introduction of sound waste management practices could reduce them significantly. Outcomes Commissioned by the South Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP), the CSIRO study used information gathered from government reports and estimates supplied by government and industry staff. However, at the time of the study, many of the datasets and scientific models of environmental and economic systems were unavailable or incomplete. Therefore, the results depend significantly on expert judgements and informed assumptions and so need to be used with that in mind. The environmental valuation in this project is based on the cost savings and avoidance (CSA) approach. This measures damage costs and defensive expenditure that would be avoided in the absence of pollution. The CSA approach is based on market goods only and, therefore, excludes non-market goods such as biodiversity and cultural assets. These important issues still need consideration and should be handled within policy formulation and decision making processes via other means.
