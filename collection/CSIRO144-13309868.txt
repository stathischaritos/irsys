Overview A scientific challenge&#160; About the scientists&#160; Awards Overview Tomorrow&#8217;s clothes could have durable electronics incorporated into the fabric. The ability to weave threads of electronic wizardry into fabrics means the IQ of textiles is rising sharply. We have already seen smart garments boast fashion items such as integrated MP3 players and mobile phone keypads. That&#8217;s impressive, although the magic is performed with copper wires, added after garment manufacture. The next generation of gifted garments will get their brains from conductive polymers, a special class of organic polymers capable of conducting electricity. But like the human brain itself, this functionality is fragile. As these garments repeatedly stretch and flex, particularly during wear and machine washing, the fine polymer filaments can break, cutting the vital circuits. A scientific challenge Working with the University of Wollongong&#8217;s Intelligent Polymer Research Institute, Dr Mark Looney and Mr Peter Waters at CSIRO have now found a way of &#8216;seamlessly&#8217; integrating conducting polymers into the structure of textiles. The process results in a firm bond between the conducting polymer and the fabric. Dr Looney says the electronic circuitry is tightly integrated into the fabric, make it quite resilient. The process is also versatile. &#8216;We can treat individual fibres, and then knit or weave conductive designs or patterns into the textiles with standard processing systems and machinery. Or we can treat made-up garments.&#8217; Either way, the embedded electronic functionality is more durable and stable, even surviving the knockabout world of machine washing. 'Our patented technology enables us to seamlessly integrate electric functionality into textiles' Mr Peter Waters CSIRO Textiles produced by the new process have potential to incorporate an array of communication devices, and act as sensors for temperature, strain, pressure, humidity, and chemical biosensing. These might also be used as barriers to electromagnetic radiation, as anti-static treatments, and for heating and cooling. Garments and other products manufactured from these textiles could make daily life easier, healthier, safer and more comfortable. About the scientists The research team, operating out of Textile and Fibre Technology, is headed by Principal Scientists Dr Mark Looney and Mr Peter Waters. Dr Looney&#8217;s expertise is in polymer synthesis, and Mr Waters is skilled in applying materials to textiles. The University of Wollongong expertise is in conductive polymers. Awards Mr Peter Waters, Dr Mark Looney and the Conductive Polymers Research Team (in collaboration with the University of Wollongong&#8217;s Intelligent Polymer Research Institute) were rewarded the ICSM 2004 prize for Australian Innovation at the International Conference on the Science and Technology of Synthetic Metals. This award was&#160;for their paper Preparation of electroconductive textiles based on a molecular templating process.
