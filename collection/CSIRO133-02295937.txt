Better estimates of air pollution in tunnelsIn 2005-06, CSIRO scientists provided estimates of pollution emission rates from vehicles in road tunnels that are more accurate than figures previously used by road construction companies. CSIRO climate model results used for international benchmarking studiesIn 2005-06, CSIRO results were used for international benchmarking studies and will be part of the next international science assessment of climate change. CSIRO’s climate system model adopted for use by Australian universitiesIn 2005-06, the CSIRO Mk3L model, a comprehensive climate system model, was the first Australian climate system model that has been made generally available to university users.  Deep-sea corals provide key to climate changeCorals taken from depths of 1 000 metres are signalling a previously unknown pattern of temperate and oceanic climate change that has occurred over the past 200 years. Fishery assessment in south-east AustraliaIn 2005-06, CSIRO developed a scientifically based assessment and harvest strategy framework for the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery, and provided it to the client, the Australian Fisheries Management Authority. New classifications system for marine bioregionsIn 2005-06, the National Marine Bioregionalisation of Australia provided a framework for classifying Australia’s marine environment into bioregions relevant to their physical environment and ecological communities. New method for calculating national greenhouse gas emissionsIn 2005-06, CSIRO and other collaborators in the Greenhouse Gas Accounting CRC completed four comprehensive measurement programs quantifying nitrous oxide emission factors for major agricultural systems. New stock assessment techniques for the Northern Prawn FisheryNew data and innovative modelling technology have led to more accurate stock assessments for the Northern Prawn Fishery. Planning for climate change in the Murray-Darling BasinRegional climate change scenarios have been completed for the Murray-Darling Basin. Changes in water availability as a result of climate change will have a significant impact on how water is managed in the region. Turtles escape trawls with TEDsAn assessment of bycatch reduction practices in the Northern Prawn Fishery (NPF) yielded good news for turtles, larger sharks and rays, but warns greater efforts are needed to protect smaller species from incidental capture.
