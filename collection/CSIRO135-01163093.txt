Great Barrier Reef Catchments: safeguarding the ReefThe Water for a Healthy Country Flagship is working in the Great Barrier Reef Catchment to improve water quality, wetland integrity and fisheries while enhancing agricultural productivity. Managing Australia’s pestsCSIRO is conducting research into pest adaptation and management which is essential for sustainable agriculture and to protect our ecosystems. Precision Agriculture: profiting from variationCSIRO's Precision Agriculture research is helping farmers understand and benefit from landscape variation.   Precision Viticulture: understanding vineyard variabilityCSIRO’s precision viticulture research gives grapegrowers and winemakers the tools to manage vineyard variation and make better use of financial and natural resources. River Murray region: supporting a healthy working riverThe Water for a Healthy Country Flagship is helping governments, industries and communities increase the social, economic and environmental benefits from water use in the River Murray region. Profile - Project   Allocating environmental funds across regions in QueenslandCSIRO has developed an analysis tool for the Queensland government to enable financial resources to be allocated according to agreed criteria, and indicators of natural resource assets and threats. Allocating funds for environmental programs: investing in catchment management programs in NSWCSIRO’s strategic landscape investment model (SLIM) provides a new tool to make decisions about natural resource investments against a range of objectives over time and space. Ants give clues to ecosystem healthThe use of ants and other invertebrates as ‘bioindicators’ is enabling scientists to assess the restoration of mining sites, as well as the management of fires and grazing in tropical savannas. Dynamic habitat of the Coorong, Lower Lakes and Murray Mouth (CLLAMM)The Water for a Healthy Country Flagship will deliver dynamic habitat maps and models that can be used to investigate the effects of river flows on key plant and animal species in the Coorong, Lower Lakes and Murray Mouth (CLLAMM) region of South Australia.
