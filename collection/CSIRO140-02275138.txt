 Return to normal viewCommonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research OrganisationDr Andre Zerger is a spatial analyst with CSIRO Sustainable Ecosystems.Dr Andre Zerger: managing resources with spatial technologyDr Andre Zerger applies spatial technologies to issues ranging from managing natural hazards to assessing the biodiversity benefits of revegetation. Current activities&#160; Background Academic qualifications&#160; Achievements&#160; Current activities Dr Zerger is a Senior Research Scientist with CSIRO's Sustainable Ecosystems&#160;division and&#160;has a broad research interest in applying geospatial technologies to natural resource management challenges and spatial decision support.&#160; His current research portfolio centres on developing&#160;methods for: assessing biodiversity benefits from vegetation enhancement activities vegetation mapping regional scale vegetation condition modelling using: GIS remote sensing predictive modelling. Background Dr Zerger joined CSIRO in 2003 as a Spatial Analyst. His earlier research&#160;was in natural hazards and the use of spatial&#160;methods for&#160;risk reduction, with a major focus on flood risk modelling and interfacing models with geographical information systems (GIS). Dr Zerger began his research career in 1991 as an environmental analyst and cartographer&#160;at the University of California, in the USA, developing&#160; and managing&#160;a&#160;GIS to support teaching, research and data inventory at nature reserves. Prior to joining CSIRO, Dr Zerger was a lecturer in GIS, spatial analysis and&#160;environmental modelling and mapping in the Department of&#160;Geomatics at the&#160;University of Melbourne (1999-2003) in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Academic qualifications Dr Zerger completed a Bachelor of Science with Honours in 1991 from the Department of Geography at Monash University in Melbourne. In 1993 he received a&#160;Master of Applied Science from the&#160;Department of Geomatics at the&#160;University of Melbourne for his work on the role of spatial dependence and sample resolution on the predictive&#160;modelling of&#160;vegetation communities. He was awarded his&#160;Doctor of Philosophy&#160;in 1999 from the&#160;Australian National University,&#160;in Canberra in the Australian Capital Territory,&#160;for his research on flood risk modelling in north Queensland. His doctoral&#160;work was supported by a scholarship from the United Nations'&#160;International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction.&#160; Achievements Dr Zerger is a Committee Member and Fellow of the&#160;Modelling and Simulation Society of Australasia. In 2005 he co-convened the MODSIM2005 conference in Melbourne. He has supervised nine Masters students since 2000 and is currently supervising three&#160;doctoral&#160;students. He is an active reviewer for: Environmental Modelling and Software, Elsevier Natural Hazards, Kluwer Academic Applied Geography, Kluwer Academic Geographical Analysis, Ohio State University Press&#160; Landscape and Urban Planning, Elsevier. Dr Zerger has presented his work at conferences, workshops and symposia in Australia, New Zealand, Pakistan, America, Canada, Russia, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and China.
