Last year CSIRO Textile and Fibre Technology, working in conjunction with the NanoTech Institute of the University of Texas at Dallas in the US, created spun yarn for the first time from tiny fibres, which measure as little as a millionth of a millimetre in diameter. Now, in a further step forward, the two organisations have unveiled a new process in which the carbon nanotubes, with properties that include high tensile strength and electrical and thermal conductivity, can also be made into wafer-thin, flexible, transparent sheets. Not only do these sheets retain the electrical conductive properties of the carbon nanotubes, they are stronger than steel sheets of the same weight. Ken Atkinson, project leader in textile research and development at CSIRO, says producing sheets made from carbon nanotubes widens their potential applications to include products such as television screens, computer displays or solar energy collection panels. &ldquo;There are a number of applications that it can be used with,&rdquo; he says. It has been envisaged that the yarn might be used in the development of military-style clothing, incorporating sensors that identify a soldier&rsquo;s location and physical condition, and Mr Atkinson says the sheets can also be used in other textile applications. &ldquo;You could lay the sheet onto a membrane and then bond the membrane to fabric, so underneath you&rsquo;ve got the conductivity and the properties that you want and yet it&rsquo;s protected from the environment,&rdquo; he says. A patent is being sought and Mr Atkinson says commercial applications for the sheets are still being defined. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a revolutionary material with a range of different properties, but we&rsquo;ve got to be right on the button in terms of producing what people want to pay for. We&rsquo;re going through that exercise now.&rdquo; For further information contact: CSIRO Enquiries Email: Solve@csiro.au Web: www.csiro.au Tel: 1300 363 400 International: +61 3 9545 2176 Back to main IN THIS ISSUE POWER GENERATION: The Power of Teamwork REMOTE SENSORS: The Secret Life of Cattle FIBRE TECHNOLOGY: Smarter Than the Average Wear BIOINFORMATICS: Bioinformatics Lifts Agribusiness INFRASTRUCTURE TECHNOLOGY: Business Tunes into its Products LIGHT METALS: Travel Light LIGHT METALS: The Tip of an Arc Welder WOOD PRODUCTS: Wood's Knock-On Effect MOLECULAR TECHNOLOGY: Quality Through and Through FOOD FUTURES / PREVENTATIVE HEALTH: Take Three Times a Day BUILDING MATERIALS: Concrete Cast in a New Light TRAFFIC MONITORS: Eyes on the Road MINERALS PROCESSING: Microwave Gets the Recipe Right METALS MANUFACTURING: Sheets Ahead of the Rest ALTERNATIVE ENERGY: Stepping on the Gas MINERALS PROCESSING: Spinner Becomes a Screen Star Home About Us eSubscribe Links Last Updated: November 11, 2005 &copy; 2005 CSIRO Australia.
