Biodiversity &amp; Ecology Bushfires Climate &amp; Weather Water Environmental Monitoring &amp; Analysis Forests Pest Management Pollution Sustainability, Pollution &amp; Waste Management CSIRO has a strong commitment to undertake research that is focussed on the environmental challenges facing Australia today. Our aim is to understand the connections between natural, agricultural, industrial and urban ecosystems. In combining this research with economic and social processes, we are working towards Australia&#8217;s sustainability. &#8220;Our knowledge and capacity places CSIRO in the position to make a meaningful contribution to the environment through the diversity of healthy ecosystems, viable industries and vital communities.&#8221; Dr Steve Morton, Group executive for environment CSIRO The opportunity and the challenge for CSIRO is to form the partnerships that will ensure that we deliver useful outcomes through our science to the people who will make decisions about the use of our natural resources. Biodiversity &amp; ecology We're finding ways to preserve and restore biodiversity and looking to create a balance between human development and conservation. We are also researching the ways in which species interact to maintain healthy ecosystems. Bushfires Australian scientists have come together to conduct research and develop technologies to increase the understanding of, and the ability to manage, bushfires, recognising that fire is an integral part of the sustainable management of Australia&#8217;s landscape. Climate &amp; weather We conduct research into weather, climate and atmospheric pollution, concentrating on environmental issues affecting Australia and the world. Water Responding to one of the most pressing challenges facing Australia, we are developing scientific solutions for more sustainable, efficient and innovative use of our limited fresh water resources. CSIRO is also involved in research into Australia&#8217;s vast marine zone, as a contribution to its sustainable use. Environmental monitoring &amp; analysis We help planners and policy-makers make sound environmental management decisions, based on reliable information. Forests CSIRO is committed to finding ways to protect forests and environmental solutions for forestry activities. Pest management Our scientists aim to understand how pests interact with their environment and how to control them. We use modelling to understand pest populations and biotechnology to find new ways to control certain pests. Pollution CSIRO researchers are helping answer questions about pollution by monitoring environmental contaminants, developing cleaner industrial and energy processes, and introducing clever remediation techniques. Sustainability, pollution &amp; waste management Understanding what makes a sustainable society and environment is a complex question that we are addressing across many sectors and disciplines.&#160;Combating pollution and better management of waste materials are two key focuses of our research.
