Dr Fraser became the first scientist to measure the presence of ozone depleting chemicals in the Southern Hemisphere. Dr Fraser&#8217;s research has significantly contributed to Australian and global policies for the protection of the ozone layer, while enhancing the national and international reputation of CSIRO. Watch&#160;this video, produced by CSIRO PUBLISHING, about Dr Fraser's contributions to CSIRO and his work on ozone depleting chemicals. Find out more about CSIRO's work with&#160;Climate Change.
