Population analysis and futures modelling Perspectives on &#8216;optimal&#8217; population levels and growth vary across society.&#160; Debate from interest groups presents well-defined arguments for various population levels and growth policies.&#160; CSIRO informs the population debate by investigating potential effects on the environment, the economy and resources from population levels and growth. CSIRO is informing this debate by investigating the effects of different population levels and policies on: the environment the economy resource sustainability Population analysis and futures modelling To obtain a balanced understanding of both the positive and negative aspects of population requires an effective integration of their likely impact on natural and human systems such as the environment, the economy and society. Our futures modelling work uses complex and holistic computer models to investigate how these areas are affected and interact under different population growth and management scenarios. Read about CSIRO's systems modelling work for&#160;assessing development sustainability. Fast facts Understanding the effects of population and population growth is a critical scientific question for society Our work informs decision makers on the effects population policies may have CSIRO uses holistic computer modelling to investigate effects population scenarios could have on the environment, industry and society in Australia&#160; Primary Contact CSIRO EnquiriesPhone: 1300 363 400*Alt Phone: 61 3 9545 2176 Fax: 61 3 9545 2175 Email: Enquiries&#64;csiro.au*local call within Australia© Copyright CSIRO 2006
