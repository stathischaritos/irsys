A problem for our lungs How CSIRO has helped A problem for our lungs The damage, which particles from pollutants in the air can inflict on the human respiratory system, depends among other factors on their dwell time in the lungs. While coarse particles get trapped mechanically before they reach the lungs, very fine particles get breathed in and out without staying in the lungs for very long. Intermediate size particles, however, with particle diameters typically between 0.2 and 10 micrometer have the capacity to enter the lungs and stay there for an extended period of time, during which they can cause poisoning &#8211; if they are toxic &#8211; or cause allergic reactions. Mechanical filters find extensive application in various areas of personal protection, most notably in industry where workers may be exposed to very fine dust or pollutants. More recently, electrostatic filters have entered this area of air filtration due to their low resistance to airflow, which allows persons using these media to breathe more easily through the filter. How CSIRO has helped With co-funding from Australian Wool Innovation Ltd, CSIRO has developed an electrostatically charged wool filter medium which consumes little energy, is highly efficient and makes breathing easier.&#160; The material has a high dust holding capacity and therefore long lifetime. It is suitable for use in air-conditioning systems, personal respirators and many other industry applications. The technology has been transferred to an Australian manufacturer who has produced filter media on commercial scale equipment and, based on independent tests, have shown that the media outperforms a range of commercially available competitive products.&#160; The company will be launching products based on this material into the global market.&#160;This&#160;will create a new market and therefore contribute to increasing the demand for Australian wool. This work was funded by Australian Wool Innovation Ltd. Learn more about CSIRO's work in&#160;Textiles.
