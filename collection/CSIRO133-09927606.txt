Augusta-Margaret River: science and local knowledge for sustainabilityThe Augusta-Margaret River region of Western Australia is celebrated for its wine, food, creative industries, surf, and natural beauty – and the local shire council is partnering with science to ensure it stays that way. Catalyst futures: helping sustainable planning on the NSW Central CoastThe recent Catalyst futures project has revealed the complexities of managing change in a rapidly urbanising community close to two growing cities, Sydney and Newcastle, on the eastern seaboard of Australia. DesignCheck™: state and national building industry award winnerDesignCheck™ is an automated design checking system enabling quick and easy compliance assessment against building codes helping designers to find potential problems early. Designing better transport systems for the sugar industryCSIRO is applying mathetmatical models to optimise the complex interactions in the sugar industry's harvesting and transport operations. Future use of Sunshine Coast sugarcane landscapesA report detailing CSIRO research that assesses rural land use options is helping with tough decisions facing sugar farmers and planners on the Queensland Sunshine coast. Planning for climate change in the Murray-Darling BasinRegional climate change scenarios have been completed for the Murray-Darling Basin. Changes in water availability as a result of climate change will have a significant impact on how water is managed in the region. Solution   Identifying and tracking goodsCSIRO researchers have developed an internet-based radio-frequency identification system that will allow tracking of consignments anywhere in the world.
