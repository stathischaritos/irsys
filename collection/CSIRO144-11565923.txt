The best questions received will be published in The Helix magazine. Jo Chris Matt Dana We've searched CSIRO to find the best minds to help you with science. Inside each issue, The Helix crew will answer your curly science questions. Jo Hi, I'm Jo and I work at the CSIRO Parkes Telescope. I also spend time at CSIRO Industrial Physics and the ICT Centre. I loved technology ever since I was a kid. I had to be the first person to get the latest gadget, from computer games to mobile phones. Sometimes, wading through pages of mathematical equations and computer code is a drag. But, I do get to work with some amazing hi-tech equipment,&#160;such as&#160;the Parkes radio telescope dish, lasers and super computers. Chris G'day I'm Chris and I work at CSIRO Mining and Exploration; sometimes I hang out at CSIRO Minerals. Our planet is an amazing place and we rely on it a lot. I got into geology and mining because I want us to&#160;use our resources better and have less impact on the environment, but still maintain our standard of living. The Helix crew can answer your sticky science questions I love getting out into the field, from mines below the ground and volcanoes in New Zealand, to the inside of a cyclone. I've even been to Antarctica to do some meteorological observations. It's amazing where science can take you. Matt My name is Matt and I work at CSIRO Sustainable Ecosystems. My work also means that I spend time at CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric&#160;Research and CSIRO Entomology. I love nature, from the smallest wasp or lizard to the largest kangaroo or oldest tree. I love hiking, especially through the Snowy Mountains and the arid desert region of Central Australia. Sometimes I get to combine my research with a holiday - last year I helped tag sharks at the Great Barrier Reef. I believe science can help us to better understand our environment and make sure that we pass our planet onto the next generation in better nick than it is now. Dana Hello, I'm Dana and I work at CSIRO Molecular and Health Technologies. I also spend time with my colleagues at Food Science Australia. I love science because it can help improve our lifestyle. I enjoy working in the lab, testing new techniques for improving our health and making sure that our food is healthier and safer. My work is also a good opportunity to help less fortunate people in developing countries. As you can see I love coffee, going out with friends and eating at restaurants and outdoor cafes; I think this is what led to me working in this field.
