Great Barrier Reef Catchments: safeguarding the ReefThe Water for a Healthy Country Flagship is working in the Great Barrier Reef Catchment to improve water quality, wetland integrity and fisheries while enhancing agricultural productivity. Managing Australia’s pestsCSIRO is conducting research into pest adaptation and management which is essential for sustainable agriculture and to protect our ecosystems. Precision Agriculture: profiting from variationCSIRO's Precision Agriculture research is helping farmers understand and benefit from landscape variation.   Precision Viticulture: understanding vineyard variabilityCSIRO’s precision viticulture research gives grapegrowers and winemakers the tools to manage vineyard variation and make better use of financial and natural resources. River Murray region: supporting a healthy working riverThe Water for a Healthy Country Flagship is helping governments, industries and communities increase the social, economic and environmental benefits from water use in the River Murray region. Profile - Project   Allocating environmental funds across regions in QueenslandCSIRO has developed an analysis tool for the Queensland government to enable financial resources to be allocated according to agreed criteria, and indicators of natural resource assets and threats. Allocating funds for environmental programs: investing in catchment management programs in NSWCSIRO’s strategic landscape investment model (SLIM) provides a new tool to make decisions about natural resource investments against a range of objectives over time and space. Ants give clues to ecosystem healthThe use of ants and other invertebrates as ‘bioindicators’ is enabling scientists to assess the restoration of mining sites, as well as the management of fires and grazing in tropical savannas. Dynamic habitat of the Coorong, Lower Lakes and Murray Mouth (CLLAMM)The Water for a Healthy Country Flagship will deliver dynamic habitat maps and models that can be used to investigate the effects of river flows on key plant and animal species in the Coorong, Lower Lakes and Murray Mouth (CLLAMM) region of South Australia. Economic costs of solid waste pollution in PalauPalau is renowned for its pristine natural environment which supports tourism, fishing and other extractive industries, as well as a resident population. Crucial to ensuring the ongoing quality of Palau’s natural environment is effective management of solid waste. Economic costs of water pollution in Rarotonga, Cook IslandsWater pollution is a significant issue for many small island nations with fringing reefs. CSIRO estimated that sound watershed management could save the community of the Cook Islands millions of dollars that currently are spent dealing with the consequences of water pollution. Efficient harvesting and transport for Australian sugarCSIRO mathematical modelling is providing efficient scheduling and logistics for the Australian sugar industry’s complex harvesting and transport sector, delivering significant cost savings and contributing toward the sugar industry’s long-term viability. Farm Water FuturesThe Water for a Healthy Country Flagship is developing and demonstrating processes to help farmers make operational decisions that reduce the impact of salinity and waterlogging on their farms and the environment.   Great Barrier Reef sustainable grazingWater for a Healthy Country Flagship researchers are working with grazing communities to develop new land-management practices that will help protect the Great Barrier Reef from excess sediment and nutrient deposits from catchments. Increasing irrigation efficiency across the Murray RegionFlagship research in the Murray region is showing that big water savings are possible while maintaining existing crops and reducing negative environmental impacts. Integrated land and water planning in the MalleeThe Water for a Healthy Country Flagship is addressing environmental, economic and social issues in the Mallee region of south-eastern Australia. The outcome will be security of irrigation development while protecting the environment. &#160;Key species responses to water managementThe Water for a Healthy Country Flagship will map the responses of key species to changes in aquatic environments and water management regimes in the Coorong, Lower Lakes and Murray mouth. Linking farmers to markets in South AfricaResearch by CSIRO and South African partners is supporting an emerging group of smallholder farmers to enter commercial markets through improved productivity and sustainability. Livestock for a sustainable environmentCSIRO scientists are tackling issues such as salinity, soil acidity, erosion, herbicide resistance and climate change through a range of integrated research activities using livestock. Making best use of environmental water in the Murray ValleyThe Water for a Healthy Country Flagship is assessing how key drivers, such as the timing, duration and quality of water flows, influence the ecological health of the Murray River, its wetlands and its floodplains. Measuring the benefits from conservation projects in the Wet Tropics World Heritage rainforestMeasuring the benefits from conservation projects in the Wet Tropics World Heritage rainforest region in north Queensland, Australia. Profiling the Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI)The Sustainable Communities Initiative brings together participants from across the public, private and civil sectors to work in partnership with communities to develop innovative solutions to sustainability challenges and opportunities. Rainforest seed dispersal: a threatened ecological processSeed dispersal in tropical rainforests is being studied to understand its important ecological role in the spread of weeds and maintaining diversity and structure in plant communities. Return of the Dawn Chorus to NSW farmlandCSIRO and its collaborators are helping farmers to understand the biodiversity benefits of their revegetation activities and improve farm sustainability.
