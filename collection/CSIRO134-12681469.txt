The technique has even revealed an earlier painting beneath the visible one in a painting by Sérusier.   Minerals Exploration  Finding oil and gas deposits CSIRO’s Characterisation Team has combined geophysics, geo statistics and reservoir engineering to develop new ways to find oil and gas deposits. This work won them a CSIRO Medal in 2004. Mining CSIRO is studying mining systems to deliver savings, expand minable reserves, and improve mine safety.Minerals Processing &amp; Metal Production  CSIRO works with minerals processing companies to get more from their materials, improve their processes, and integrate today’s most advanced technologies. Mining &amp; Minerals Tools &amp; Technologies  CSIRO researchers have developed a suite of products to make mining, mineral processing and metal production safer and more efficient.   What's NewSite map: CSIRO Minerals, Waterford WACutting Edge Lecture Series (Victoria)Cold water eddy ‘monsters” mighty current off Sydney (Podcast 20 Mar 07)Cold-water eddy ‘monsters’ mighty current off Sydney (Media release 13 Mar 07)More National Research FlagshipsFind out about the Flagship Program Flagship Collaboration FundLight Metals BusinessFind out about Doing Business Air, Atmosphere and Weather student workshop (New South Wales)Australian Air Quality Forecasting SystemTechnology for rapid mineralogical analysisEco Enigma student workshop (South Queensland)More Watch &amp; ListenTitle: Cold water eddy ‘monsters” mighty current off Sydney (Podcast 20 Mar 07)Size: 5988 KBMore Site Map Using this Site Legal Notice and Disclaimer Privacy Copyright Last updated: 20 March 2007
