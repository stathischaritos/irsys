What you need What to do What's happening What you need To do this experiment you will need: a balloon a hair dryer. What to do Blow up the balloon and tie it off. Turn on the hair dryer and point it so the stream of air is blowing towards the ceiling. Hold the balloon in the stream of air and then let go. If you've never done this experiment before, you'd probably expect the balloon to float up and then fall to one side. What actually happens is that the balloon hangs in the middle of the air stream. Diagram of the 'staying up there' experiment What's happening The balloon hangs in the stream through a balance of forces. The downward pull of gravity is balanced by the upward push of the air flow. The balloon&#160;stays in the centre of the air stream because the fast moving air has a lower pressure than the surrounding still air. If the balloon starts to&#160;move&#160;out of the air stream, the higher pressure of the surrounding air pushes it back. Try tilting the hair dryer a bit. What happens now?
