Introduction What is the SCI? Project methodology Who&#160;is involved in the SCI? Introduction Collaboration across public, private and civil sectors is essential in finding solutions to complex sustainability challenges. Building on CSIRO&#8217;s experience in researching systems-based approaches to regional scale sustainable development, CSIRO has been working with organisations from across the public, private and civil sectors to explore how we might better work together to realise sustainable outcomes for Australian communities. Through these interactions the Sustainable Community Initiative (SCI) has evolved. What is the SCI? The Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI) is a program that brings together participants from across the public, private and civil society sectors, to work in partnership with communities to develop and deliver innovative solutions to community specific sustainability challenges and opportunities. The SCI is an &#8216;action learning&#8217; program that will operate for a three year period (2006-09). The SCI partners with local governance institutions to undertake projects addressing local sustainability challenges and opportunities. The SCI undertakes projects in partnership with communities across a range of diverse geographical and socio-economic landscapes. SCI projects will support communities to: define local challenges and opportunities&#160; develop and implement effective responses&#160; plan futures, order priorities, and make informed investment choices realise measurable &#8216;triple bottom line&#8217; outcomes through investments&#160; learn from experience and build adaptive management capacity. Individually, SCI projects deliver local 'triple bottom line' outcomes. Collectively, they provide insights and learnings&#160;that inform community-scale, sustainable development policy, programs and practice. Project methodology The approaches underpinning the SCI are based on learnings from over&#160;ten years of CSIRO research conducted in Australian communities. The SCI model takes a systems approach to identifying the drivers of community issues and challenges by understanding the interrelationships between local economic, environmental, social and governance systems. The SCI model brings together the relevant&#160;elements to take&#160;a holistic approach to planning and development. Through this process the drivers and levers of change are identified and appropriate and sustainable development pathways and investments are explored and tested. The SCI model brings together the relevant knowledge, competencies and resources from across multiple partners/sectors that take this holistic approach to planning and development. Who is involved in the SCI? To date 15 organisations from across the public, private and civil society sectors have committed to work together through the Sustainable Communities Initiative. These organisations include: private Westpac Banking Corporation Insurance Australia Group (IAG) Harvey Norman GRM International Delfin Lend Lease public CSIRO Department of Environment &amp; Water Resources Department of Transport &amp; Regional Services Department of Family &amp; Community Services and Indigenous Affairs Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Department of Industry, Tourism &amp; Resources civil Australian Local Government Association The Natural Edge Project Philanthropy Australia World Wildlife Fund ICLEI &#8211; Local Governments for Sustainability.
