Maintaining water for irrigation Delivering water savings Maintaining water for irrigation In the Murray-Darling Basin the major concern is the availability and quality of water under current and future climatic, economic and environmental scenarios. The urgent needs of river ecosystems and a possible decline in future rainfall and runoff mean that supplies for irrigation may become more limited.&#160; Research is showing that big water savings are possible while maintaining crop yields and reducing negative environmental impacts. Production from irrigation need not decline with reduced water availability.&#160; There are good opportunities to improve the efficiency of delivering and using irrigation water through targeted application of technology, smart water management and better climate forecasts. Delivering water savings Our initial work has indicated that about 295 gigalitres could be saved from the Murrumbidgee and Coleambally Irrigation Areas while maintaining the current area of crops and reducing the environmental impacts of irrigation. Research will continue to assess options for increasing efficiency of irrigation in other irrigation regions in the Murray through: potential water savings&#160; from on farm and system reticulation losses and channel seepage water saving options&#160; such as improved irrigation management local and regional economic and environmental benefits of increased water use efficiency identifying tradeoffs between on-farm productivity objectives and regional ecological and hydrological targets in response to water management practices.
