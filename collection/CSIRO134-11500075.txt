This work won them a CSIRO Medal in 2004. Helping China re-vegetate the Loess PlateauA CSIRO developed tool is helping China's land and water resource managers rehabilitate an important water catchment and helping to secure China's environmental future. SedNet sediment network modeling softwareSedNet is a simple, testable, physically-based distribution model for catchment sediment transport which, by modeling sediment transport, can give healthier catchments and rivers. Underground communications system improves mine safetyCSIRO's new underground communications system provides timely and useful information for improved mine safety. Audio   Cold water eddy ‘monsters” mighty current off Sydney (Podcast 20 Mar 07)In this six-minute podcast Dr David Griffin, from the Wealth from Ocean's Flagship, explains how a huge dense eddy was the reason the sea was so cold off the coast of NSW this summer. DataTraceDNA takes up fight against fake art fraudsters (Podcast 2 Mar 07)Mr Greg Twemlow from DataTraceDNA explains how technology developed by CSIRO is tackling the problem of fake art in this six-minute podcast. Capability   Creating machines that sense and respondOur expertise combining intelligent sensors and computing leads to machines and products that can interact with their environment and alter the way they function. Driving improvements in oil and gas productionCSIRO delivers science solutions vital to a globally competitive and sustainable energy industry with a primary focus on oil, gas and geothermal energy resources. Exploring the new physics of the nanoscaleCSIRO’s large, integrated team of professional scientists and engineers research the new physics of the nanoscale. They cover biomimetics, nanoparticle films, biosensor arrays and molecular electronics. It's not rocket science... it's rockin' scienceWearable intelligent textiles, incorporating electronic circuitry and sensors, are well suited to become the basis of the next generation of control systems for many applications of mobile computing, allowing complete freedom of movement.
