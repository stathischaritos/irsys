It then shows him demonstrating it. &#8220;Developing the air guitar was a technical challenge for precision textile-based sensing.&#8221; Dr Richard Helmer Research engineer CSIRO Textile &amp; Fibre Technology The intent of this clip is to&#160;explain the instrument, its&#160;postural flexibility and ability to repeatedly play performance parts with the CSIRO wearable instrument shirt guitar. The wearable instrument shirt is a conventional black long sleeve T-shirt and the textile motion sensors used by the instrument for monitoring elbow movements and&#160;computer interface are not directly discernable in the garment.
