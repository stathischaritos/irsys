This new resource will enable our biomedical research team to experiment with tissue engineering from textile structures. CCI small sample weaving machine (video)A 30-second video showing the slow and gentle operation of the CCI sample weaving machine which enables CSIRO to rapidly produce small samples of customised fabric from a diverse new range of fibres. Award-winning carbon nanotube (video)This two-and-a-half-minute video discusses the work of Mr Ken Atkinson and his team from CSIRO Textile &amp; Fibre Technology for their work on dry-formed carbon nanotube structures for advanced textiles which won the team a 2006 CSIRO Medal for Research Achievement. Building blocks of the future (Podcast 02 Dec 2006)Dr Swee Liang Mak talks about a new lightweight concrete panel technology, called HySSIL, in this three-and-a-half-minute podcast. Playing the air guitar (Podcast 13 Nov 06)Dr Richard Helmer talks about a shirt that lets the user play real music on an air guitar in this five-minute podcast. Air shower to cut water use (Podcast 10 Nov 06)Dr Dilip Manuel describes the 'air shower' which saves water, but still feels as good as a normal shower in this four-minute podcast. Wearable guitar instrument shirt interview (video)This one-minute video interviews Dr Richard Helmer about CSIRO's wearable instrument shirt guitar, which works by recognising and interpreting arm movements and relaying this wirelessly to a computer for audio generation, and then shows him demonstrating the shirt with a backing track. Wearable instrument shirt: guiro (video)An 11-second video demonstrating the wearable instrument shirt playing a simple moderately paced rhythm with occasional accents that simulate a guiro being stroked slowly upward and struck downward quickly. Wearable instrument shirt: tambourine (video)This 21-second video shows scientists demonstrating the wearable instrument shirt playing as a simple moderately paced tambourine rhythm with occasional accents that simulate a tambourine being shaken as well as tapped for accent. Wearable instrument shirt: guitar (Video)This 48-second video shows CSIRO's wearable instrument shirt guitar, a conventional black long sleeve T-shirt, which works by textile motion sensors being used by the instrument for monitoring elbow movements and making the necessary computer interface while not directly discernable in the garment. Protecting your home from bushfire (Podcast 27 Sep 06)Mr Justin Leonard discusses ways you can prepare your home against bushfires in this seven-minute interview. Simulating ocean weather (video)A three-minute video showing the BLUElink ocean forecasting model, which was run in hindcast mode for the period 1992-2001. Titanic animations (video)A 20-second video with three examples which demonstrate how CSIRO’s world leading research is making animated fluid flows – like splashes, bubbles, eddies, whirlpools, water and smoke – more realistic. Wool, fibre of the gods (video)This three-and-a-half-minute video animation, produced by CSIRO, looks at the various elements of the wool fibre and the properties that each part contributes to wool's usefulness. Titanium: cutting the costs in half (video)A 46-second video showing CSIRO's pioneering work on a new production process for titanium powder that is faster and at a much lower cost than conventional methods.   Magnesium: from thick to thin (video)A one-minute video showing how, after four years of work by research scientists and engineers, CSIRO has developed a process capable of producing thin magnesium-alloy-sheet direct from the molten metal. A new jet aeration nozzleA CSIRO designed gas liquid nozzle is making gold production more efficient by reducing oxygen wasted during processing. Spinning carbon nanotubes (video)This five-minute video shows how old meets new as the ancient technique of spinning is used to produce a very modern material – a carbon nanotube yarn. The ability to spin carbon nanotubes into a yarn that retains the carbon fibres’ remarkable properties could have a range of important applications, from medicine to the aerospace industry. A sunscreen for bottles (video)Light-induced damage is a significant problem for food and beverage products packaged in glass bottles. Using nanotechnology CSIRO has produced a solution, explained in this video.     Under surface radar (video)This two-minute video shows how CSIRO has developed a radar system that makes it easier to see behind walls and under floors. Concrete from waste (video)In this two-minute video see how waste products from steel mills, burning coal and silicon production are being used to make concrete. Plastic from plants (video)This two-minute video explains how CSIRO scientists have created an environmentally friendly plastic from wheat. In-wheel motor for sun powered cars (video)Watch a two-minute video that shows how CSIRO has developed a motor small enough to fit in the wheel of a solar car. UV blocker: nanotechnology sunscreen (video)In this two-minute video see how zinc nanoparticles in sunscreen are now more effective and almost invisible. New material creates lighter aeroplanes (video)In this two-minute video see how a new material developed by CSIRO reduces the need for hundreds of metal fasteners holding aeroplane parts together.
