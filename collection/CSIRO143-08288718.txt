Pure zircon process provides a solution for mineral sands processorsA process which lowers the radioactive and non-radioactive impurity levels of zircon could provide mineral sands processors with an economic method of accessing previously unattractive zircon deposits. Textiles as templates for tissue growthCSIRO scientists are using textile support structures as templates for the growth of new tissues for use in maintaining, restoring or improving the function of damaged tissues and organs. Driving Innovations student workshop (Victoria)Find out how science has become an integral part of designing safe and environmentally friendly cars in the Driving Innovations program for Years 5-8 in Victoria. Nonwoven textile research facilities at Geelong, VictoriaCSIRO’s modern nonwoven production mill produces small samples, and also allows product development on pilot scale equipment. Fibre bonding is achieved by chemical or heat treatment, needlepunch or hydroentanglement. Netherlands Institute of Applied Geoscience (TNO): partnership to map oil reserves in the North SeaCSIRO Petroleum has teamed up with The Netherlands Institute of Applied Geoscience (TNO) and five major international energy companies to use CSIRO-developed technology in developing a database of petroleum reserves in the North Sea. Total Easy Care technologyTotal Easy Care delivers wool knitwear and woven apparel with the added benefit of the ability to machine wash and tumble dry whilst retaining all the natural properties of wool’s soft handle, resilience, lustre and the essential performance characteristics of breathability and insulation. Instrument and machine prototypingCSIRO's instrument and machine prototyping team combines with our engineering workshop to rapidly prototype and modify instruments for a range of projects and industry needs. Wool filters for use in air-conditioning systemsIn 2005-06, with co-funding from Australian Wool Innovation Ltd, CSIRO has developed an electrostatically charged wool filter medium which achieves high efficiency at remarkably low pressure drops or energy consumption.  Environmental Stewardship Initiative for the Australian Wool IndustryCSIRO is working with the Australian wool industry to identify greasy and processed wool that meets the requirements of new European legislation on pesticides and other chemical residues, which come into effect in 2007 Advanced fibrous materials: lighter, stronger, smarterAdvanced materials improve the design and fabrication of products, introducing new qualities such as biodegradability, thermal and electrical conductivity, high-strength, flexibility and fire resistance. Prototype engineering workshopCSIRO's experience with toolmaking and fine machining enables us to customize tooling and manual programming to suit the most complex needs. It's not rocket science... it's rockin' scienceWearable intelligent textiles, incorporating electronic circuitry and sensors, are well suited to become the basis of the next generation of control systems for many applications of mobile computing, allowing complete freedom of movement. Measuring textile properties and tracking chemical residuesDemand for CSIRO’s pesticide residue testing service is expanding as woolgrowers and brokers prepare for tougher environmental requirements in Europe. Sirolan Laserscan™: providing better measurementsSirolan Laserscan™ instrument measures individual fibre snippets by laser and produces accurate measurements of fibre diameter SiroFAST™ fabric quality assurance systemSiroFAST™ system tests fabrics for compression, bending, extension and dimensional stability. Textile processing and manufacturing servicesCSIRO offers a textile processing and manufacturing research and development service through its pilot-scale textile mill. Australian partnership in Light Metals researchThe Light Metals Flagship is working with the ARC Centre of Excellence for Design in Light Metals and the CAST CRC to develop light metals technologies that will help in the global race to make lighter, fuel-efficient cars. Australian Medical Sheepskins prevent pressure ulcersCSIRO’s new high-performance Australian Medical Sheepskin is more dense and has a higher wool pile for superior comfort. A novel tanning process produces sheepskins rugged enough to withstand multiple washes at 80 °C, representing a significant advance in leather technology. On-farm testing takes wool classing into the 21st centurySirolan Fleecescan™ is a transportable testing system for fibre diameter that woolgrowers can use for improving their flocks through selective breeding. Fabric repair costs cut by 90 per centSiroCLEAR™ is capable of detecting a single dark fibre in a worsted yarn at winding speeds of up to 1 600 metres per minute and it has revolutionised the detection and removal of faults in yarns. Strong single-ply wool yarn for weavingSOLOSPUN™, a simple and inexpensive mechanical add-on to conventional spinning machinery, produces robust, single-ply worsted yarns with dramatically increased abrasion resistance, enhancing the yarn’s ability to withstand the stresses of weaving. Surface and materials scienceCSIRO fabricates and tests substances such as titanium powders, photocatalysts, biomedical materials and hard coatings. Superconducting devices and systemsCSIRO has one of the world’s biggest groups of superconductivity scientists working on detectors for applications in geophysics, physical security, food safety and oceanography and in the frontier science of quantum engineering. Gas aids copper recoveryCSIRO scientists have developed a way to recover copper from slag using natural gas that should save mining companies time and money.
