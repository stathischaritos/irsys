Nearly 15 per cent of people in high-care nursing homes have a skin tear at any one time, according to research at the Victorian College of Pharmacy. Dr Sharon Edwards: using textiles to support and guide tissue growthA post-doctoral scientist at CSIRO’s textile laboratory in Geelong, Dr Edwards is investigating medical applications of textiles — in particular, the use of textiles to support cell growth and tissue regeneration, healing damaged tissues, such as nerves. Dr Richard Helmer: engineering next generation intelligent textilesThe virtual air guitar showcases CSIRO’s expertise in the design and manufacture of intelligent, electronic textiles for controlling computers and adding functionality to many products. Dr Sally Hutchinson: drawn by chemistry’s power to explainIn her research on medical textiles, Dr Sally Hutchinson has devised a method that gives a visual indication to patients and health care professionals on the level of pathogenic bacteria present, and hence the health of the wound. Dr Louis Kyratzis: repairing and regenerating tissues on textile scaffoldsCSIRO researchers are working on textile structures that can form foundation structures for promoting the repair or regeneration of nerves, skin, and spinal discs.
