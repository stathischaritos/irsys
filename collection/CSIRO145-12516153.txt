Overview Advantages of CFD Skills and experience Implementation Overview Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is a computer modeling technique that can simulate: the flow of liquids, gases and particles reactions heat transfer other phenomena. CSIRO has expertise in developing, applying and validating simulation software based on complex mathematics. Advantages of CFD CFD offers a number of significant advantages, including: cost effectiveness - CFD allows testing of a large number of variables without modifying existing plants risk reduction- CFD can predict performance at any scale, thereby minimising the risk inherent in designing large-scale plants and reducing the number of pilot stages required to scale-up timeliness - results are available in a short time safety - CFD is particularly useful in simulating conditions where it is not possible to take detailed measurements. Skills and experience CSIRO&#8217;s research and development in computational fluid dynamics is done across a number of sciences and we are well placed to bring together multi-disciplinary teams from different areas of our organisation.&#160; Our expertise covers a broad range of skills and applications in this area, including: commercial CFD codes (Fluent, CFX and Phoenics) in-house software design for specific situations visualisation software (Tecplot, AVS) supercomputer access world-class simulation software based on Discrete Element Method, Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics and Finite Element Methods. CSIRO also has laboratory and pilot-scale facilities for process development and optimisation and proven experience in model validation, including: computer-controlled laser Doppler, phase Doppler and particle image velocimetry, and electrical-resistance tomography experimental modeling physical modeling. Implementation CSIRO uses CFD to predict and model: CSIRO has used CFD to help animate fluids in movies and games. machine and plant design parameters liquid and fine particle flows separation and mixing blasting and fracturing milling grinding crushing. CSIRO has even used CFD to help animate fluids in movies and games. CSIRO has used CFD on a number of major projects including: animating fluids in movies and games modeling tsunamis, dam breaks, flooding, lava flows, landslides and mud flow simulating complex fluid flows such as metal fabrication and biomedical systems modeling fluid interactions such as green water loads on ships, sloshing in tanks analysing mining, minerals processing and powder mixing equipment developing new processes for extracting and refining minerals and metals maximising throughput in oil and gas operations exploring equipment designs for mills, sample cutters, transfer chutes and ingot casting systems.
