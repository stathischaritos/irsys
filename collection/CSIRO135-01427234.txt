See CSIRO Textiles &amp; Fibre Technology's capabilities, facilities and services here. Capability   Advanced fibrous materials: lighter, stronger, smarterAdvanced materials improve the design and fabrication of products, introducing new qualities such as biodegradability, thermal and electrical conductivity, high-strength, flexibility and fire resistance. Characterising materialsCSIRO’s material characterisation expertise helps improve product performance and resilience across a range of product types and operating conditions.   Cotton processing research adds value to Australia’s cropTo combat falling international prices and competition from synthetic fibres, the Australian cotton industry relies on CSIRO research for continuing quality improvement. Exploring applications for carbon nanotubesCSIRO is looking at the industrialisation of the spinning process to utilise nanotubes which create textiles that can conduct heat and electricity. Fibrous materials characterisationModern electron and optical microscopy is used to study materials where the problem is invisible to the naked eye. Our highly skilled microscopy unit uses state of the art microscopes both electron and optical with imaging and analysis facilities to solve a vast range of problems. Instrument and machine prototypingCSIRO's instrument and machine prototyping team combines with our engineering workshop to rapidly prototype and modify instruments for a range of projects and industry needs. It's not rocket science... it's rockin' scienceWearable intelligent textiles, incorporating electronic circuitry and sensors, are well suited to become the basis of the next generation of control systems for many applications of mobile computing, allowing complete freedom of movement. Measuring textile properties and tracking chemical residuesDemand for CSIRO’s pesticide residue testing service is expanding as woolgrowers and brokers prepare for tougher environmental requirements in Europe. Nonwoven textile research facilities at Geelong, VictoriaCSIRO’s modern nonwoven production mill produces small samples, and also allows product development on pilot scale equipment. Fibre bonding is achieved by chemical or heat treatment, needlepunch or hydroentanglement. Preventing injuries and promoting healingOur researchers are testing injury prevention limb covers to prevent or reduce skin tears and other injuries. We are also developing advanced textiles with integrated sensing and response technologies to promote healing of burns, scars and ulcers.
