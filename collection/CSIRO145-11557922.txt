Overview Skills and expertise Implementation Partnerships Overview CSIRO is helping to revitalise Australia&#8217;s cities through the generation of new technologies and integrated infrastructure solutions capable of providing a 20 per cent reduction in urban ecological footprints. Skills and expertise CSIRO has identified three technological streams that would amount to a substantial contribution to Australia&#8217;s shift to sustainable urban development practices: high performance buildings that allow adaptable, more efficient facilities, healthy environments and a better fit with client and user requirements distribution systems such as waterand energy wherein reliable, cost-effective technologies reduce resource use while meeting community expectations complex city modelling systems that provide an understanding of regional social, economic, and environmental factors and allow our cities a pathway to transition to sustainable configurations. Implementation To ensure Australian cities have robust and adaptable infrastructure, buildings and healthy environments, CSIRO has identified areas where new technologies are required: building processes and performance models: CSIRO is revitalising Australia&#8217;s cities through the generation of new technologies and integrated solutions capable of 20 per cent reduction in urban ecological footprints. management system for client-demand performance requirements integrated whole life suite of management tools whole building process and performance models property investment models: product service life and life cycle inventory database property management system investment decision-making tools human-indoor environment interaction: smart building management system smart indoor environment laboratory improved water quality: small scale decentralised treatment systems higher water quality standards, techniques and processes new generation monitoring and control: improvements to monitoring of water quality new sensors and control strategies new treatment technologies: membranes physical and biological systems. Partnerships CSIRO&#8217;s collaborators on the urban sustainability program include: Commonwealth, State and Local Governments Cooperative Research Centre for Water Quality and Treatment Cooperative Research Centre for Construction Innovation Water utilities and industry groups The United Nations&#160; The World Bank.
