What we do Our facilities Our staff Our partners Recent achievements CSIRO Textile and Fibre Technology is recognised as one of the leading&#160;fibre and fibrous materials&#160;research centres in the world, with programs on wool, cotton and a range of new materials. What we do CSIRO Textile and Fibre Technology operate a multi-fibre research, development and innovation facility, located in Geelong, Victoria. We support the Australian natural fibre industries, in particular wool and cotton. Our work aims to: improve the use of wool in modern apparel find alternative uses for wool improve the quality and processing of Australian cotton develop new advanced fibres and materials grow the technical textiles industry (textiles used for industrial, environmental, medical or military purposes). Our facilities Geelong, Victoria Textile and Fibre Technology&#8217;s Geelong facility has comprehensive pilot-scale wool and cotton fibre, textile processing facilities and an engineering workshop&#160;that can be used for a variety of purposes. These facilities combine commercially realistic processing conditions with a controlled research laboratory setting. The facility also includes: a&#160;technical textiles facility with needle-punch, hydroentanglement and bi-component fibre extrusion equipment - this can be used to develop nonwoven products such as thermal insulation, filters, automotive carpets or industrial and domestic wipes National Association of Testing Authorities (NATA) accredited facility for environmental and textile testing, and act as consultants in environmental sustainability for the textile industry. Clayton, Melbourne, Victoria Our Clayton site houses facilities for developing advanced materials in nanotechnology, carbon nanotube yarns, conductive polymers, smart textiles, medical textiles and advanced fibres. Our staff Our staff delivers research into textiles through the application of physics, chemistry, engineering, environmental science and textile technology. CSIRO Textile and Fibre Technology operates a multi-fibre research, development and innovation facility, located in Geelong, Victoria. Our partners CSIRO collaborates with a range of partners from business, government, Cooperative Research Centres (CRCs) and universities to deliver its research, including: Australian Wool Innovation Ltd.
