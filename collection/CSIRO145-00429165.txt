Overview Outcomes About the scientists Collaboration Overview The Vital Signs Sensor project is creating a robust non-contact vital signs sensor which can monitor a patient&#8217;s heart-rate and breathing, without touching their skin. Such technology will be particularly useful to elderly patients, whose skin is often frail and easily damaged by electrodes and other monitoring equipment. Moreover, sensors which do not rely on gels or adhesive patches, and use mainstream wireless technology, can provide continuous monitoring of vital signs for extended periods for both ambulatory and stationary patients. In an emergency, the software controlling the data system can send text messages to family physicians or other carers Having released the current prototype in July 2005, the project plans to release an improved version in June 2006. Outcomes Continuous monitoring will not only assist in patient care, it will also create longitudinal records of patient information which can then be used as a diagnostic tool, or to assist other research. Information recorded from multiple users can also be recorded in a data system and accessed by carers using standard web browsers. In an emergency, the software controlling the data system can send text messages to family physicians or other carers, set up a direct voice link between the subject and a call centre (similar to centres already used by personal alarm systems), or notify emergency services directly.
