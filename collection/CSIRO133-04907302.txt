Nonwoven textile research facilities at Geelong, VictoriaCSIRO’s modern nonwoven production mill produces small samples, and also allows product development on pilot scale equipment. Fibre bonding is achieved by chemical or heat treatment, needlepunch or hydroentanglement. Fibrous materials characterisationModern electron and optical microscopy is used to study materials where the problem is invisible to the naked eye. Our highly skilled microscopy unit uses state of the art microscopes both electron and optical with imaging and analysis facilities to solve a vast range of problems. Total Easy Care technologyTotal Easy Care delivers wool knitwear and woven apparel with the added benefit of the ability to machine wash and tumble dry whilst retaining all the natural properties of wool’s soft handle, resilience, lustre and the essential performance characteristics of breathability and insulation. Instrument and machine prototypingCSIRO's instrument and machine prototyping team combines with our engineering workshop to rapidly prototype and modify instruments for a range of projects and industry needs. Environmental Stewardship Initiative for the Australian Wool IndustryCSIRO is working with the Australian wool industry to identify greasy and processed wool that meets the requirements of new European legislation on pesticides and other chemical residues, which come into effect in 2007 Wool filters for use in air-conditioning systemsIn 2005-06, with co-funding from Australian Wool Innovation Ltd, CSIRO has developed an electrostatically charged wool filter medium which achieves high efficiency at remarkably low pressure drops or energy consumption.  Advanced fibrous materials: lighter, stronger, smarterAdvanced materials improve the design and fabrication of products, introducing new qualities such as biodegradability, thermal and electrical conductivity, high-strength, flexibility and fire resistance. Prototype engineering workshopCSIRO's experience with toolmaking and fine machining enables us to customize tooling and manual programming to suit the most complex needs. It's not rocket science... it's rockin' scienceWearable intelligent textiles, incorporating electronic circuitry and sensors, are well suited to become the basis of the next generation of control systems for many applications of mobile computing, allowing complete freedom of movement. Measuring textile properties and tracking chemical residuesDemand for CSIRO’s pesticide residue testing service is expanding as woolgrowers and brokers prepare for tougher environmental requirements in Europe. Sirolan Laserscan™: providing better measurementsSirolan Laserscan™ instrument measures individual fibre snippets by laser and produces accurate measurements of fibre diameter SiroFAST™ fabric quality assurance systemSiroFAST™ system tests fabrics for compression, bending, extension and dimensional stability. Textile processing and manufacturing servicesCSIRO offers a textile processing and manufacturing research and development service through its pilot-scale textile mill. Australian Medical Sheepskins prevent pressure ulcersCSIRO’s new high-performance Australian Medical Sheepskin is more dense and has a higher wool pile for superior comfort. A novel tanning process produces sheepskins rugged enough to withstand multiple washes at 80 °C, representing a significant advance in leather technology. On-farm testing takes wool classing into the 21st centurySirolan Fleecescan™ is a transportable testing system for fibre diameter that woolgrowers can use for improving their flocks through selective breeding. Fabric repair costs cut by 90 per centSiroCLEAR™ is capable of detecting a single dark fibre in a worsted yarn at winding speeds of up to 1 600 metres per minute and it has revolutionised the detection and removal of faults in yarns. Strong single-ply wool yarn for weavingSOLOSPUN™, a simple and inexpensive mechanical add-on to conventional spinning machinery, produces robust, single-ply worsted yarns with dramatically increased abrasion resistance, enhancing the yarn’s ability to withstand the stresses of weaving. Resilin: a new biocompatible ‘rubber’ proteinCSIRO has developed a biocompatible ‘rubber’ protein that promises a wide range of innovative medical and industrial applications. Understanding wool fibresBetter understanding of the chemistry and surface properties of wool fibres is the focus of CSIRO’s fundamental wool research.   Rubber from resilin research paperA team of CSIRO scientists have copied resilin, the elastic protein that facilitates flight and jumping in insects. As reported in Nature (13 October 2005), the team was the first to clone a portion of the resilin gene from fruitfly and turn it into the most resilient rubber known. Chemical testing helps woolgrowers meet tougher eco rulesAll textile producers and processors must meet tough new standards if they want to do business in Europe. CSIRO’s internationally accredited chemical testing service is assisting the wool industry comply with Europe’s Eco-label requirements.   Preventing injuries and promoting healingOur researchers are testing injury prevention limb covers to prevent or reduce skin tears and other injuries. We are also developing advanced textiles with integrated sensing and response technologies to promote healing of burns, scars and ulcers. Cotton processing research adds value to Australia’s cropTo combat falling international prices and competition from synthetic fibres, the Australian cotton industry relies on CSIRO research for continuing quality improvement. Textile testing laboratoryCSIRO’s textile testing laboratory offers consultancy services and access to fast, cost-effective textile research and development.
