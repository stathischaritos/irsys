Our Mission By understanding the connections between natural, agricultural, industrial and urban ecosystems and economic and social processes, and by building effective partnerships, we will underpin Australia&rsquo;s journey towards sustainability. What we do CSIRO Sustainable Ecosystems (CSE) undertakes world-class research and development focused on challenges of social, economic and environmental sustainability in Australian landscapes. Research approach: We use a systems research approach to understand the connections between natural, agricultural, industrial and urban ecosystems and the degree to which the management of these systems is shaped by economic and social processes. More CSE develops its research portfolio within four themes to provide a focus for research outcomes: Future Cities Healthy Ecosystems Resilient Regions and Communities Sustainable Rural Livelihoods How we do it Research delivery: CSE administers research through five Research Programs covering regional and national geographic landuse types: Tropical Landscapes Agricultural Landscapes Rangelands and Savannas Resource Futures Urban Systems Partnerships: Promoting research partnerships is a key target and CSE works collaboratively to tackle complex projects with other areas of CSIRO, and with many research institutes nationally and internationally. Innovative science combined with research and end-user partnerships make sure that CSE is asking the right questions to deliver meaningful, long-term outcomes to the people who govern, manage and live in Australia&rsquo;s natural and built environments. CSE also provides client services in such things as production systems modelling, natural resource management, ecological analysis, mine site rehabilitation advice, community and regional planning, urban sustainability and other sustainability science areas. CSE is a stakeholder in several Australian Cooperative Research Centres (CRCs) including: Construction Innovation CRC Plant-based Management of Dryland Salinity CRC Rainforest CRC Sugar CRC Tropical Savannas CRC Weeds CRC Site locations Where we are Our staff are based at the following laboratories located around the country. Urrbrae Laboratory in Adelaide Centre for Arid Zone Research (CAZR) in Alice Springs Tropical Forests Research Centre (TFRC) in Atherton Queensland Bioscience Precinct (QBP) in Brisbane Gungahlin Homestead in Canberra Tropical Ecosystems Research Centre (TERC) in Darwin Highett Laboratory in Melbourne Floreat Laboratory in Perth North Ryde Office in Sydney Davies Laboratory in Townsville Agricultural Production Systems Research Unit (APSRU) Offices in Toowoomba CSE also has staff co-located with the Australian Tropical Forest Institute in Cairns and at the University of Tasmania in Hobart. CSE within CSIRO Australia's national research organisation CSE is one of 17 research Divisions and 2 joint ventures that make up the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). The Divisions also contribute to 6 National Research Flagship programs that focus on new and priority areas of research for CSIRO and Australia by promoting cross-organisational research partnerships. CSE forms part of the CSIRO Sustainable Energy and Environment sector with activities primarily directed towards science for sustainable approaches to development and environmental management. Other CSIRO Divisions in this sector include Energy Technology, Land and Water, Marine and Atmospheric Research and Petroleum Resources.
