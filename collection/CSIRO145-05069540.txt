Planning for a sustainable future for south-western Western Australia Key project outputs Planning for a sustainable future&#160;for south-western Western Australia The CSIRO Sustainable Ecosystems Resource Futures Program (RFP) has recently completed the Augusta-Margaret River Sustainable Future Project &#8211; a two-year research partnership between the Shire of Augusta-Margaret River in south-west Western Australia,&#160;and CSIRO Sustainable Ecosystems. The research team used a systems approach to create a Regional Development Futures (RDF) framework to facilitate its work with regions in addressing future sustainability.&#160; This framework uses four stages: developing partnerships creating the foundation opportunities for change building resilient futures. The framework&#160;uses participatory approaches to combine local and scientific knowledge, and&#160;has also been used in the Central Coast and Campbelltown-Camden in NSW. The research provided an in-depth study of the complexities of managing change in a rapidly urbanising sea change community in coastal Australia. The tools, processes, and scenarios developed will assist to inform and evaluate strategies and actions for the Augusta-Margaret River Shire Council as well as those of other local organisations and groups. A major outcome from the work is to provide&#160;an in-depth study of the complexities of managing change in a rapidly urbanising sea change community in coastal Australia. Key project outputs The key outputs of the project are listed below. Full pdf versions of the reports are&#160;available through the Shire of Augusta Margaret River. Oral history report An analysis of qualitative data from&#160;ten oral history focus groups run with 55 long-term residents aimed to document how the region arrived at its current state and identify some of the values people consider important to sustain for the future.&#160;&#160; Regional profile&#160; A 90-page referenced profile of the region that brings together social, economic and environmental data to provide a current picture of the region, which is helping to inform local planning policies.&#160;&#160; Public workshops and report&#160; A report on the locality (Augusta, Cowaramup and Margaret River) and seven scenario public workshops. Volunteering in Augusta-Margaret River report&#160;&#160; A report on community organisations and their key volunteers, used to help gauge and monitor sense of community. Absentee property owners' survey and report Non-permanent residents were identified as a critical sustainability issue.&#160; The report has established baseline data, has four associated journal papers in press and preparation, and&#160;outlined concerns of this issue for sea change regions. &#160; System dynamics tools Analysis with system dynamics modelling tools&#160;gave contrasting scenario options for the future and enabled interactive&#160;scenario development.&#160;&#160; Community survey Curtin University of Perth&#160;will run the community survey developed as part of the project.&#160; A similar survey being run as part of the Waterline Project in Bass coast will enable cross-regional comparison.&#160;&#160;&#160; Training Training in systems thinking, using the system dynamics modelling and software, and in using and updating data was conducted throughout the duration of the project with shire staff, councillors and the youth advisory committee.
