Up: How to Write an AIPS++ Application Previous: Binding objects with non-standard constructors Testing Your Application Provide a test global function called yournametest() (e.g., imagetest) inside the .g file that contains your
application code. Exercises all the functionality as thoroughly as
possible. This should be similar to the demonstration function but
much more complete. If the test runs correctly, return True, otherwise
return False. Remember to test failure modes as well as things that
are supposed to work! Next: Debugging Your Application Up: How to Write an AIPS++ Application Previous: Binding objects with non-standard constructors Contents Please send questions or comments about AIPS++ to aips2-request@nrao.edu.Copyright &#169; 1995-2000 Associated Universities Inc.,
