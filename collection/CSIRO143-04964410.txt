CSIRO runs an interactive robotics program for students in Years 3-6 in the Northern Territory . Netherlands Institute of Applied Geoscience (TNO): partnership to map oil reserves in the North SeaCSIRO Petroleum has teamed up with The Netherlands Institute of Applied Geoscience (TNO) and five major international energy companies to use CSIRO-developed technology in developing a database of petroleum reserves in the North Sea. It's not rocket science... it's rockin' scienceWearable intelligent textiles, incorporating electronic circuitry and sensors, are well suited to become the basis of the next generation of control systems for many applications of mobile computing, allowing complete freedom of movement. Fluorescence Alteration of Multiple Macerals (FAMM™) for thermal maturity evaluation of source rocksCSIRO offers improved analysis of the thermal maturity of petroleum source rocks, that enable petroleum explorationists to identify previously unrecognised prospective areas. The technique, termed FAMM™ analysis, employs laser fluorescence microprobe technologies. SEE Grid: open standards for earth and environmental dataCSIRO is a founding member of the Solid Earth and Environment Grid (SEE Grid) community which fosters the development and adoption of open standards for web-based informational and computational services in the earth and environmental sciences.   Locating bushfires as they happenSentinel Hotspots provides reliable 'eyes' in the sky for Emergency Services, using satellite images to locate and map bushfires occurring in Australia and providing the information to anyone on the internet. Strontium Isotope Stratigraphy serviceCSIRO’s Strontium Isotope Stratigraphy (SIS) provides greater chronostratigraphic control of basin evolution, which is important for petroleum exploration. Superconducting devices and systemsCSIRO has one of the world’s biggest groups of superconductivity scientists working on detectors for applications in geophysics, physical security, food safety and oceanography and in the frontier science of quantum engineering. Rice Gene Machine Information Management SystemCSIRO has developed software and processes to help biologists, lab managers and technicians manage the mass of data generated by large-scale, high-throughput plant mutagenesis experiments. Identifying and tracking goodsCSIRO researchers have developed an internet-based radio-frequency identification system that will allow tracking of consignments anywhere in the world. Lego Robotics student workshop (Canberra)What’s a robot? How does it work? Can you make your own? You can in the Lego Robotics program run by CSIRO in the ACT. Increasing production ratesMathematical modelling was one of several approaches which helped James Hardie to increase production rates for their reinfored cement building products. Predicting and reporting for natural resource managementCSIRO is leading the development of modelling technology for natural resource management in Australia and our prediction and reporting technologies will allow natural resource managers to model scenarios digitally and save millions of dollars. Exploring the new physics of the nanoscaleCSIRO’s large, integrated team of professional scientists and engineers research the new physics of the nanoscale. They cover biomimetics, nanoparticle films, biosensor arrays and molecular electronics. Lego Robotics (Years 5 - 6) student workshop (New South Wales)Teach something else to do work for you. CSIRO Education in NSW runs a Lego Robotics program for Year 5 - 6 students. Managing risk for Australian banksCSIRO is working with several banks in Australia to ensure high quality risk management. Reditus™ finance softwareCSIRO helps resource managers by effectively analysing the underlying risks posed to environmental systems. Putting remote sensing on the mapCSIRO and the Australian Greenhouse Office have developed remote sensing tools and technologies that allow Australia to accurately measure land cover change over the past 30 years. Resistivity from oil-water inclusions (ROI™) serviceResistivity from Oil-water Inclusions (ROI™) is a technique used by CSIRO for the petroleum industry to determine water saturation in oil reservoirs. Managing complex systemsCSIRO is applying systems and complexity theory to optimise the performance and efficiency of market areas such as manufacturing, mining, infrastructure, logistics and security. Automated detection of road cracksCSIRO’s automated road sensing system, RoadCrack, is able to find cracks in road paving down to a width of one millimetre at high speeds, reducing the cost and increasing the accuracy of road crack detection.   Understanding artificial intelligenceWith the development of advanced artificial intelligence technology, CSIRO scientists are taking automated systems process to a new level of capability. Lego Robotics student workshop (South Queensland)Robots are becoming more and more common in our daily lives. Experiment with your own robot in the Lego Robotics workshopfor Years 2 - 12, run by CSIRO Education in South Queensland.   Utilising remote sensing dataCSIRO develops applications that make use of remote sensing data to help spot bushfires in remote areas, predict the weather and map land, vegetation and oceans. Driving improvements in oil and gas productionCSIRO delivers science solutions vital to a globally competitive and sustainable energy industry with a primary focus on oil, gas and geothermal energy resources.
