Mass-rearing Release Redistribution Evaluation Once approval for release of a new biological control agent has been obtained from Biosecurity Australia and the Department of Environment and Heritage, the agent is mass-reared and&#160;released throughout the distribution of the target weed.&#160; The agent is and then evaluated to determine its impact on the weed populations. Integrated weed management or the release of additional agents can be considered to enhance the overall impact on the weed. CSIRO conducts research on all of these aspects, often together with state or community collaborators. Mass-rearing The aims of mass-rearing are to cost-effectively produce a large, continuous supply of healthy agents (insects or pathogens) to release into the field. Techniques generally have to be developed or adjusted for each agent. Mass-rearing can be labour intensive or relatively straight forward.&#160;Some insects can easily be reared in large cages while others cannot be reared at all. In the latter case, adults are collected from the native range, screened for parasites within a containment facility and then released in the field. Fungal pathogens, which are often used for biological control of weeds, are either mass-cultured on artificial medium,&#160;as with facultative parasites, or on live plants&#160;as with rust. Approved biocontrol agents are mass-reared and released throughout the target weeds distribution. In&#160;all cases&#160;careful attention is paid to ensure that genetic diversity of insect populations or genetic integrity of pathogen isolates is maintained and hygiene standards are very high. Release Small experimental field trials are often made to determine an appropriate release strategy before wide-scale distribution of the agent takes place. These field trials are used to determine optimal release numbers and timing, to gather information to assist with site selection and to assess whether cages should be used or sites be prepared (bated for predators) prior to release. Redistribution Once an appropriate release strategy has been determined, the agent is redistributed to strategically located sites in collaboration with other land management organisations, landholders or community groups. Evaluation Post-release evaluation of the agent is critical to determine whether it has established, is spreading and is having an impact. The evaluation stage is helpful to improve release strategies, optimise impact through integrated weed control and assist in the selection of future additional agents.

Fast facts Approved biocontrol agents are mass-reared and released throughout the distribution of the target weed Agents are evaluated after their release&#160;to determine their establishment rate, spread and impact Integrated weed management is often used along with the release of&#160;additional agents to maximise impact Primary Contact Mrs Julie Carter (BSc GradDipEd)Communication ManagerCSIRO EntomologyPhone: 61 2 6246 4040 Fax: 61 2 6246 4177 Email: Julie.Carter&#64;csiro.auRelated Areas Invasive plants CSIRO Entomology Biosecurity Australia&#160;[external link] Department of the Environment and Heritage&#160;[external link] Related Topics Biological control: choosing the best potential agent Biological control: choosing the target weed Biological control: host specificity testing Biological control: native-range surveying Biological control: non-target impacts Steps in a weed biological control program &#160;/csiro/content/standard/ps2hh.html/org/ps2hh.html/content/ps2hh.html Site Map Using this Site Legal Notice and Disclaimer Privacy Copyright Last updated: 16 November 2006
