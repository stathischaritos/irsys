Sea change for fisheries Developing methods and tools Growing aquaculture and biotechnology Sea change for fisheries Australian fisheries management is shifting its focus from individual target species, to one that considers the full effects of fishing on marine ecosystems. This requires a broad understanding of fisheries ecosystems to support more flexible and complex management approaches. Ecosystem-based fisheries management requires scientific understanding, assessment and management of: the effects of fishing on target and non-target species and their habitats the effects of fishing on marine food webs the impact on fisheries of other human activities, climate variability and change the productivity of marine systems the socio-economic aspects of fishing. Developing methods and tools CSIRO&#8217;s Marine Ecosystems and Resources research theme is conducting research to help balance the use and conservation of Australia's marine resources and ecosystems. Some of the methods and tools being developed include: biological sampling, underwater visual and acoustics systems, monitoring programs and electronic tagging of wide-ranging species to understand and assess the distribution and dynamics of marine ecosystems computer modelling to assess population numbers, fisheries stocks and ecosystems, scientific evaluation of fisheries harvest strategies, ecological risk, ecological indicators and management targets. These methods and tools support the management of: northern prawn, Torres Strait and Great Barrier Reef ecosystems domestic and internationally shared shark, tuna and billfish fisheries and ecosystems fisheries and ecosystems off south-eastern Australia. Growing aquaculture and biotechnology Further research in this theme will support the growth of Australia&#8217;s aquaculture and biotechnology industries. Developing the scientific foundation for ecosystem-based management is a challenge for fisheries worldwide. Improved breeds and feeds are being developed to raise the efficiency and sustainability of aquaculture systems. Our aquaculture breeds research, which is focused on prawns, Pacific oysters, Atlantic salmon, and abalone, is: using DNA markers to trace the genetics of wild founder populations and farm stocks, and identify genes associated with economically important traits working with commercial partners on selective breeding for improved growth rates, disease resistance, performance on alternative diet ingredients and product quality. Fishmeal is the principal protein source in aquaculture feeds for most species, but the demand is set to outstrip supply. Two approaches are being taken to develop higher-performing aquafeeds with reduced fishmeal content: replacing fishmeal with terrestrial protein sources such as lupins, and applying biotechnology to develop alternatives to wild-harvest fish as sources of omega-3 oils, including genetically modified terrestrial plant crops, single-cell oil production using fermentor technology and novel marine microbial technology.
