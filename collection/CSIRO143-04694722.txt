Olfactory pattern recognition research clusterThe Food Futures Flagship is working with the Australian National University and Monash University to create a new generation of electronic nose - a cybernose. Strontium as a chemical tracer serviceCSIRO Petroleum utilizes strontium as a chemical tracer to discriminate between plant and animal products grown in different locations. A food research collaboration between ANSTO and CSIROA new research collaboration between the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) and CSIRO is seeking to determine the molecular structure and function of the foods we eat. CSIRO keeps our grain the market leaderFor an expectant return of A$20 for every dollar invested in CSIRO’s Stored Grain Research Laboratory, it has to be one of the best R&amp;D success stories around. Superconducting devices and systemsCSIRO has one of the world’s biggest groups of superconductivity scientists working on detectors for applications in geophysics, physical security, food safety and oceanography and in the frontier science of quantum engineering. What's in a Biscuit student workshop (Victoria)Analyse a biscuit to determine its fat and protein content in the 'What's in a Biscuit' workshop for year 12 chemistry students in Victoria. Food Futures Flagship UPDATE newsletterThe programs of Food Futures Flagship will transform the agrifood sector of the nation through new technologies and collaborations. News from this initiative can be found in the Food Futures UPDATE e-newsletter. Rice Gene Machine Information Management SystemCSIRO has developed software and processes to help biologists, lab managers and technicians manage the mass of data generated by large-scale, high-throughput plant mutagenesis experiments. Quarantine Matters student workshop (Canberra)Help in the fight against deadly invaders! Discover and explore the science of quarantine through the Quarantine Matters student workshop in Canberra. It's a Chemical World student workshop (Canberra)There are bubbles in my drink! Where do they come from? Are they safe? Students from Kindergarten to Year 6 will discover the chemistry all around them in this program run at CSIRO’s Green Machine Science Education Centre in Canberra. Novel plant productsCSIRO develops novel products from plants for use as pharmaceuticals, industrial raw materials and unique healthy new foods. Plant breedingCSIRO’s plant breeding capabilities benefit a range of agribusiness industries from horticulture and pastoral through to broadacre crops such as wheat. Lifestyle programs that help tip the scales toward health and wellbeingOvereating and inactivity can be a direct cause of heart and bowel diseases, some cancers and diabetes. Positive lifestyle choices, such as healthy diet, adequate exercise and a good attitude, are the basis for improved health. Food Science Australia: a joint venture of CSIRO and the Victorian governmentCSIRO’s joint venture with the Victorian government created one of the world’s largest and most diverse food research organisations, consolidating research in food and nutrition, and consumer behaviour into a single agency. Advanced processing and innovative foods programCSIRO’s advanced processing and innovative foods program focuses on the creation and commercialisation of new and better foods, ingredients and bioactive products by bringing new ideas and technologies to market. Improving Murray-Darling Basin healthThe Heartlands consortium aims to improve land use in the Murray-Darling Basin to preserve land and water resources and sustain commodity production. Microencapsulating bioactives for food and pharmaceuticalsDevelopments in microencapsulation technology are creating new applications and opportunities in the food and pharmaceutical industries. Australian SME licenses technology for arthritis treatmentNew Vision Biotechnology was granted a worldwide licence for CSIRO's patented process for refining the shark cartilage derived, chondroitin sulphate, a popular alternative arthritis medicine. Spin-off company to market new beverage and chemical processCSIRO is looking to raise capital to market its new de-foaming technology, with widespread application in beverage and chemicals manufacture, through a spin-off company Airsonics.   Bayer and CSIRO alliance enjoys commercial successCSIRO's partnership with Bayer CropScience to develop a breakthrough gene technology is a success for both organisations.   Whey protein isolate: turning waste into profitAustralian researchers have developed a chromatographic system that is turning 90 per cent of the whey produced during cheese making into health and sport foods and beverages.  Sensor solution for environmental monitoringAn Australian research team has developed a system of wireless sensors to help Queensland horticulturalists better understand and measure micro-climates within a large propagation greenhouse. Finding out what’s good in our foodResearchers are analysing components that make up certain foods to determine precisely what chemical and physical effects they have when eaten. With CSIRO's expertise we will be able to tailor our diets for better health and to avoid some diseases.Food Science student workshop (South Australia)Food science helps protect us from potentially deadly food poisoning. CSIRO runs an interactive workshop on food science for South Australian students from Years 9 - 12.
