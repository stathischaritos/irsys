OPTIM™ Fine and OPTIM™ MaxOPTIM™ fibre treatment gives wool a silk like quality for extremely fine, soft and light weight fabrics. This unique technical development and innovation creates a wool fibre with a super light weight silky feel. QuickDry Merino: a new quick drying wool fabricCSIRO has produced a high performance ‘quick-dry’ finish for wool, to allow it to compete with the quick dry performance of synthetics and cotton in active sportwear markets Capability   Improving manufacturing systemsCSIRO is helping manufacturers compete globally by improving the flexibility and efficiency of their management, operations and manufacturing processes. Instrument and machine prototypingCSIRO's instrument and machine prototyping team combines with our engineering workshop to rapidly prototype and modify instruments for a range of projects and industry needs. It's not rocket science... it's rockin' scienceWearable intelligent textiles, incorporating electronic circuitry and sensors, are well suited to become the basis of the next generation of control systems for many applications of mobile computing, allowing complete freedom of movement. Measuring textile properties and tracking chemical residuesDemand for CSIRO’s pesticide residue testing service is expanding as woolgrowers and brokers prepare for tougher environmental requirements in Europe. Nonwoven textile research facilities at Geelong, VictoriaCSIRO’s modern nonwoven production mill produces small samples, and also allows product development on pilot scale equipment. Fibre bonding is achieved by chemical or heat treatment, needlepunch or hydroentanglement. Prototype engineering workshopCSIRO's experience with toolmaking and fine machining enables us to customize tooling and manual programming to suit the most complex needs. Textile processing for every stage of productionBusinesses large and small, Australian and overseas, routinely use CSIRO's fibre and textile processing facilities for small batches that require custom processing conditions. Feature Article   Innovation vital to keeping wool profitableCSIRO’s research for the Australian wool industry now includes diverse industrial filtration and medical textile applications, in addition to improving the processing technologies required to lift wool’s performance and create new markets in its traditional clothing applications. Overview   Building a future for woolWool is a complex natural fibre, with a physical and chemical structure that allows its use in a wide range of functional textile products. Industry benefits from technical textile research facilitiesCSIRO’s technical textile production capabilities include traditional knitting and weaving, three-dimensional knitting, and modern machinery for nonwoven bonding by chemical, heat or mechanical processes. Textiles overviewOur textiles research is being used not only for clothes, but for filters, gaskets, insulation, upholstery, carpets, bedding, bandages and wound dressings. Profile - Person   Dr David Evans: probing the fundamental science of woolBetter understanding of the chemistry and surface properties of wool fibres can form the basis of new processing treatments and product properties. Dr Ian Russell: A chemist in the service of woolWith the direction of organic chemist Dr Ian Russell, CSIRO has developed unique expertise in the measurement of pesticides on wool, in wool processing effluents and in the environment. Dr Richard Helmer: engineering next generation intelligent textilesThe virtual air guitar showcases CSIRO’s expertise in the design and manufacture of intelligent, electronic textiles for controlling computers and adding functionality to many products. Dr Shaun Smith: promoting technology transfer in the textile industryAs CSIRO’s Client Relationship Manager for Australian Wool Innovation Ltd, Dr Shaun Smith is responsible for day-to-day interactions between the two organisations. Profile - Project   Heat treatment of high-pressure die-castingsA new process developed by Light Metals Flagship researchers means that high-pressure die-castings can now be heat treated to improve their mechanical properties. In search of whiter, brighter woollensNew fabric bleaching technology promises to overcome the problem of wool yellowing in sunlight. It allows manufacturers to match the whites of cotton and synthetics, and to produce brighter pastel colours. Vibrant colours for wool clothingResearchers test new anti-yellowing treatments for wool fabrics after overturning established understanding of how yellowing occurs. Wash and wear wool suits looking smartCSIRO research on machine washable wool-rich suits has led to the creation of a comprehensive set of fabric and process specifications that have been applied by washable suit manufacturers in China, India and Australia. Publication - General   Australian Medical Sheepskins brochureA 20-page brochure looking at a new clinical trial which has confirmed that Australian Medical Sheepskins can reduce pressure ulcers in hospital patients by up to 58 per cent and withstand laundering up to 80 °C. Eco-label opens European wool markets (Farming Ahead Oct 04)A two-page article, originally published in Farming Ahead, which looks at implications of growing European demand for products produced  with minimal environmental impact. This article outlines how Australian wool growers and the wool supply chain can meet these requirements  Innovation vital to staying competitive (Farming Ahead, Nov 06)This two-page article from Farming Ahead looks at how CSIRO is helping Australian wool growers stay competitive with other fibres through the application of new nanotechnology and biotechnology techniques.
