The water challenge Water-smart cities For Australia&#8217;s cities, achieving the goal of sustainable water management remains the major challenge for the 21st Century. The Water for a Healthy Country Flagship is working with industry, government, and our communities to establish Australian cities as world leaders in the efficient use of water.&#160; Investing in the science needed to revitalise Australia&#8217;s urban water systems will help improve our quality of life, increase our economic security and protect the environment. The water challenge As our cities and towns grow, providing clean water and managing waste water and stormwater become ever more difficult due to: growing demand - forecasts indicate that population in Australia&#8217;s major metropolitan areas will continue to grow competing interests - tension is increasing between water required for lifestyle and industry and the water needs of the environment increasing risk - risk of sewer overflows, pollution and flooding is increasing with high density urban infill declining assets- aging infrastructure presents looming economic and environmental problems environmental stress- health of our urban waterways, wetlands, estuaries and bays is under threat. Flagship research is tackling the major challenge of sustainable water management for Australia&#8217;s cities. Most states are reviewing the adequacy of water strategies for their major urban areas with programs such as Victoria&#8217;s 'Securing our Water Future Together' and Melbourne Water&#8217;s 'Catchment to Coast'. New knowledge is needed to underpin these strategies and ensure the wisdom of the complex decision process. Water-smart cities Urban Waterscapes research is initially focusing on Australia&#8217;s major east coast cities &#8211; particularly Melbourne and Sydney. These cities are being examined as total urban systems, with a focus on the impact of urban water activities from the ocean to the outer reaches of our water supply catchments. Two major research projects tackling city water issues are: Water Smart City Systems: creating &#8217;water-smart&#8216; cities tailored to Australian culture and conditions Water Smart Communities: transforming urban water service provision.
