Catchment Modelling ToolkitThe Catchment Modelling Toolkit website provides a 'one-stop shop' to improve the standard of land and water modelling in Australia. Helping China re-vegetate the Loess PlateauA CSIRO developed tool is helping China's land and water resource managers rehabilitate an important water catchment and helping to secure China's environmental future. Improved process and design of groundwater remediation systemsCSIRO research has significantly improved the process and design of remediation systems using air sparging and multiphase extraction to treat fuel spills that contaminate groundwater systems. SedNet sediment network modeling softwareSedNet is a simple, testable, physically-based distribution model for catchment sediment transport which, by modeling sediment transport, can give healthier catchments and rivers. Capability   Assessing development sustainabilityUnderstanding the complex interactions between population, resource use and the environment is a difficult task in scenario modelling, but CSIRO is helping Australia find the right path for future sustainable development. Creating urban sustainabilityCSIRO is developing a broad range of tools to assist governments and industry revitalise Australia’s cities, meet emerging challenges and transition to a sustainable configuration. Integrating urban infrastructure and systemsCSIRO offers urban infrastructure technology to governments, global industry leaders and international bodies to help tackle the complex challenges they face in managing their transport, buildings, utilities and telecommunications infrastructure. Understanding the social implications of resource decisionsCSIRO is recognised for its expertise in the conduct and application of innovative social research for water resource management and other related issues of importance to society. Feature Article   Reshaping cities for a more sustainable futureCSIRO research is helping to revitalise Australia’s cities through the generation of new technologies that reduce the ecological footprint of urban environments.   Media Release   Bricks &amp; clicks: building design goes high tech (Media release 18 Aug 05)Planners, designers and builders will soon be able to work together using the same ‘virtual environment’ in which internet gamers compete against each other in cyberspace. Ensis scientist wins Gottstein Fellowship (Media release 1 Dec 05)A senior scientist working for the trans-Tasman forestry and forest products joint venture, Ensis, has been awarded the prestigious Gottstein Fellowship for 2006. Long term prosperity needs ‘resilience’ not just efficiency (Media release 18 Sep 06)Current approaches to sustainable natural resource management are failing us, according to Resilience Thinking – a new book by CSIRO scientist Brian Walker and science writer David Salt to be launched tomorrow (Tuesday 19 September). New standards in water-sensitive urban development (Media release 18 Oct 06)The Water for a Healthy Country Flagship has played a key role in the development of Western Australia’s largest master planned urban development. Salinity management measures set for roll out (Media release 19 Oct 06)A Catchment Demonstration Initiative (CDI) Open Day in the Western Australian Wheatbelt shire of Kellerberrin has marked the roll-out phase of a project which will see local farmers implement salinity management options on their farms. Soil information at your fingertips (Media Release 13 Oct 05)CSIRO technology is helping make light work of land management across Australia with the launch today of a new web tool – the Australian Soil Resource Information System (ASRIS). Overview   Conservation overviewCSIRO is playing a major role in the conservation of plant and animal communities with research that tackles habitat threats and provides sustainable approaches to managing our landscapes. Water for a Healthy Country Flagship overviewThe Water for a Healthy Country Flagship is a national research program addressing one of Australia’s most pressing natural resource issues – sustainable management of our water resources. Overview - Research   South-West Western Australia: supporting state water management strategiesThe Water for a Healthy Country Flagship is conducting research to increase water benefits across South-West Western Australia – from farms, towns and catchments to the complex dam and groundwater system surrounding Perth. Utilising urban water resourcesUrban water research aims to use recycling and reclamation technologies to turn stormwater, wastewater and contaminated water into usable resources. Overview - Science   Urban planning overviewAustralia’s cities are vast, inter-connected systems that pose complex planning issues - CSIRO is helping revitalise our urban environment with new design, planning and engineering technologies.Profile - Location   Canberra: Gungahlin Homestead (ACT)The Gungahlin Homestead in the Australian Capital Territory, is an historic site in the north of Canberra that now serves as head office for CSIRO Sustainable Ecosystems. Profile - Project   Great Barrier Reef floodplain renewalThe Water for a Healthy Country Flagship is helping to change floodplain land management to improve the quality of water entering the Great Barrier Reef. The program is focused on maximising productivity and ecosystem sustainability across a range of industries reliant on the floodplain. Management of remnant vegetationCSIRO scientists are investigating the ecological processes of remnant vegetation in relation to broader land management practices. Profiling the Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI)The Sustainable Communities Initiative brings together participants from across the public, private and civil sectors to work in partnership with communities to develop innovative solutions to sustainability challenges and opportunities.
