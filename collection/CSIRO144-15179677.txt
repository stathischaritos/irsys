Introduction Goals of the project Future plans Introduction With a huge concentration of people around its coastline, Australia&#8217;s coastal environments are subject to a range of impacts brought about by their use and proximity to population centres. The impacts on coastal regions are typically: environmental damage from human activities economic development and exploitation altering the surrounding topography pressures on ecosystems through recreational use. A&#160;joint research program&#160;studying the impacts of human activity and the marine environment is being spearheaded by:&#160; Wealth from Oceans Flagship New South Wales Government CSIRO. Goals of the project The research aims to provide Australian fisheries, aquatic industries and recreational marine users with access to healthy and productive regional marine ecosystems. The A$1.5 million, five-year agreement links research specialists in marine ecosystems with the Government agencies and authorities responsible for coastal and marine management. The program aims to model and predict how these intricate marine ecosystems react to the differing demands and impacts from the users of our oceans. Future plans As a new approach to ocean and coastal ecosystem management, this system involves applying a series of strategies to maintain the function of ecosystems and allow human use. The five-year project links research specialists in marine ecosystems with Government agencies and authorities responsible for coastal and marine management. Over the life of the project, the following issues and their ecosystem impacts will be considered: links between sustainable farmland in the New South Wales regions of Clarence, Hunter and Pittwater and their catchments and downstream fisheries production planning and management of coastal infrastructure associated with large cities including: port facilities shipping pollution land run-off management of rural landscapes and their impacts on aquatic systems that may affect fisheries aquaculture marine tourism regional oceanography, including the East Australian Current, and its links with: climate industry production development risk assessment of activities that affect the quality of ecosystems.
