Creating new materials Advanced fibrous materials capability Our focus New equipment for samples Other resources and facilities Creating new material New advanced, hybrid, and composite materials are created through analysing the structure, properties or behaviours of natural and human-made materials. These materials can be used to develop new components for existing or entirely new consumer goods for industries such as: construction aerospace packaging automotive military.&#160; Advanced fibrous materials capability CSIRO&#160;is developing&#160;new advanced, composite and hybrid materials&#160;based on&#160;natural&#160;or synthetic fibres. We&#160;offer expert skills in the formation of complex fibrous structures and product development. We are leading innovators in the growing technical textiles sector which makes functional and industrial textiles. Our advanced&#160; fibrous materials capability now includes: We&#160;offer world&#8211;leading skills in the formation of complex fibrous structures and product development. the production of nanofibres by electrospinning carbon nanotube (CNT) yarn and sheet manufacture bicomponent fibre extrusion the formation and characterization of structures manufactured from extruded fibres application of conducting polymers to textiles integration of electronic functions into textiles small sample circular knitting, weaving and nonwovens carding and needlepunching machines. Our focus Our focus is on the use of&#160;nano-, bio- and electro-active materials in fibrous structures to create high-value products. We&#160;focus our advanced fibrous materials research on: biomaterials (developing tissue engineering scaffolds and diagnostic devices) electroactive fibres (exploiting CNT synthesis methods and the fabrication of CNTs into yarns and fabrics and&#160;developing electrodes, batteries, sensors and interconnections for textile-based flexible electronics) ultra high throughput separation membranes (applying CNT membranes to fluid flow and filtration) high-performance clothing&#160;(using advanced technologies in clothing to monitor and improve performance, comfort and protection of sports, military and emergency services personnel) fibre solutions (offering our unique fibre and fibrous materials expertise for solutions to problems in the water, energy, health and&#160;military sectors). New equipment for samples The development of advanced composite materials is often hampered by the cost of preparing woven and knitted samples from very expensive raw materials (for example, titanium costs several thousand dollars per spool). CCI small sample weaving loom from CCI Tech Inc. Taiwan. We have installed the first CCI sample weaving machine in Australia which will massively reduce the quantity of raw material required for sample production. With the CCI, we can rapidly produce samples 38 to 76cm wide by three metres long, with low wastage of expensive yarns. What currently takes 20 to 40 kg of yarn to produce on a conventional loom now takes around half a kilogram to produce a sample. The loom can be customised to work with delicate&#160;fibres that are not made for weaving. We are currently weaving coated copper wire, manufactured for the internal mechanisms of watches to make electrically conductive fabrics. The CCI is specially adapted to handle these delicate and often brittle fibres. The machine operates slowly at 40 pics per minute, a tenth of the speed of a conventional loom and also has a slow beating action. A single rapier is used for yarn transfer and it is timed to pass through the shed opening at its widest point, thereby reducing friction on the yarn. Harry Lucas R-1s miniature circular knitting machine The Harry Lucas R-1s circular knitting machine adds to our advanced fibrous materials capability. This machine is equipped with&#160;five needles for the production of fine hollow tubes of between 2 mm&#160;to 5mm. These tubes are to be used for creating human tissue replacement devices for clinical applications. Other resources and facilities In addition to the above,&#160;CSIRO has: a pilot-scale mill facility small-scale and pilot-scale nonwoven equipment a bicomponent fibre extruder fibre electrospinning facilities carbon nanotube reactors and spinning machines engineering workshop for making prototype instruments a textile testing laboratory a microscopy unit.
