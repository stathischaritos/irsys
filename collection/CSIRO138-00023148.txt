The intent of this clip is to show the postural flexibility and ability to repeatedly play performance parts with the CSIRO wearable instrument shirt - &#8216;guiro&#8217; (a Latin percussion instrument). &#8220;Developing the objectless instruments was a technical challenge for precision textile-based sensing.&#8221; Dr Richard Helmer Research engineer CSIRO Textile &amp; Fibre Technology The textile motion sensors used by the instrument for monitoring elbow movements are clearly visible in this clip (black sleeve located on the elbows) and the sensors are connected by wires to the PC interface (not shown). Mr Thorsten Karrer plays a simple moderately paced rhythm with occasional accents that simulate a guiro being stroked slowly upward and struck downward quickly. He plays the invisible instrument held in front of him at waist height and is shown partially side on to the camera. He maintains his posture whilst making exaggerated and almost comic, body motions to play this instrument.
