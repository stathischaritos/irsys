Orica and CSIRO win DuPont Innovation Award for bioremediation productOrica and CSIRO have won a DuPont Innovation Award for the product, Landguard™, which uses enzymes to remove pesticide residues from water. Rating pesticide impactsAfter ten years of CSIRO research, the off-site impacts of different pesticides and land uses can be compared using a simple risk indicator. Removing toxic algae from ship ballast waterA new technique could help to prevent the spread of toxic algae in the ballast water of ships has been developed by CSIRO. Capability   Fighting environmental contaminationThe Centre for Environmental Contaminants Research is providing better methods by which to assess and mitigate the negative environmental impacts of a wide range of industries. Improving water quality and environmental flowsCSIRO’s skills are being used to improve the health of Australia’s rivers, reservoirs, estuaries and coastal environments by developing strategies for water allocation, environmental flow and improved water quality. Protecting our water resourcesCSIRO’s Water Resources Protection team can conduct research into water quality, contaminant dynamics, microbial processes and industrial biotechnology to assist in the management and protection of urban and industrial water resources. Understanding aquatic biogeochemistry and ecologyCSIRO contributes to healthy aquatic ecosystems by understanding and predicting ecological responses to changes in Australia’s unusual water conditions and habitats. Understanding changing landscapes using advanced analytical techniquesCSIRO’s expertise is advancing the understanding of contaminant dynamics in landscape systems by developing and applying novel molecular and spectroscopic techniques. Understanding contaminantsCSIRO supports sound policy and informed decision-making by understanding of the science of contaminants. Tools and models created by CSIRO assist pesticide users and regulators to make informed decisions. Media Release   Water smart cities for a healthy country (Media release 26 May 04)Melbourne will be part of the biggest water research partnership in Australia’s history which will re-think total urban water systems. Overview - Research   Environmental biogeochemistry: protecting our land and water resourcesTo support the maintenance and protection of Australia’s land and water resources, we provide clients with science-based solutions to predict and manage the risks posed by environmental contaminants. Great Barrier Reef Catchments: safeguarding the ReefThe Water for a Healthy Country Flagship is working in the Great Barrier Reef Catchment to improve water quality, wetland integrity and fisheries while enhancing agricultural productivity. Profile - Project   Economic costs of water pollution in Rarotonga, Cook IslandsWater pollution is a significant issue for many small island nations with fringing reefs. CSIRO estimated that sound watershed management could save the community of the Cook Islands millions of dollars that currently are spent dealing with the consequences of water pollution. Great Barrier Reef sustainable grazingWater for a Healthy Country Flagship researchers are working with grazing communities to develop new land-management practices that will help protect the Great Barrier Reef from excess sediment and nutrient deposits from catchments. Winery wastewater managementThis project aims to reduce the costs of wine production and demonstrate environmental leadership with a sustainable wastewater management strategy. Publication - Technical   Pesticide Impact Rating Index (PIRI) brochureThis two-page brochure provides details about PIRI, free software which helps pesticide users and regulators select the best product for their circumstances. The shared water resources of the Murray-Darling Basin (Part 1)This report outlines the major water characteristics of the Murray-Darling Basin and evaluates the relative importance of different sources and uses of water and criteria for establishing research priorities. The shared water resources of the Murray-Darling Basin (Part 2)This report focuses on six identified risks to shared water resources in the Murray-Darling Basin, water quality and river health: climate change, farm dams, afforestation, groundwater extraction, bushfires and irrigation water management. Resume   Dr Peter Franzmann: researching safe supplies of water for the futureDr Franzmann leads urban and industrial water research in CSIRO Land and Water. His goals include safe water-reuse applications, ever-improving water quality and new remediation techniques for problematic contaminants, and the application of industrial biotechnology to niche industries. Dr Rai Kookana: waste watcherDr Rai Kookana’s research on minimising off-site impacts of pesticides has made significant contributions to the FAO/IAEA Food and Environment Program. Dr Robyn Russell: using enzymes to clean-up pesticide and toxin residuesDr Robyn Russell’s work on bioremediation of pesticide residues will help protect the environment and ensure uncontaminated commodities. Dr Simon Toze: leading research in water reuseDr Simon Toze is a microbiologist with a current research focus on the reuse of water in urban environments, in particular involving managed aquifer recharge.
