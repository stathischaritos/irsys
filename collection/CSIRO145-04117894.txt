Award for innovation in nanotechnology Background Carbon nanotube sheets Award announcement Award&#160;for innovation in nanotechnology CSIRO and the NanoTech Institute of the University of Texas at Dallas, USA, &#160;have been awarded a 2006 NanoVic Prize for Innovation in Nanotechnology from Nanotechnology Victoria. This is a second award for this collaborative team who, in 2005, won the Avantex Innovation Prize for their breakthrough discovery of how pure carbon nanotubes can be spun into yarns. Background Interest in the potential for carbon nanotubes to create a range of futuristic materials was sparked when their structure was revealed in the early 1990s. Carbon nanotubes are pure carbon and have a diameter of about a millionth of a millimetre, are immensely strong, and are excellent conductors of heat and electricity. In 2004, Mr Ken Atkinson of CSIRO Textile and Fibre Technology, demonstrated to researchers at the Nanotech Institute of the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD) that carbon nanotubes could be twisted into a yarn in the same way as conventional fibres like wool and cotton. A partnership was formed between the two organisations to further this research. Carbon nanotube sheets&#160; Following this discovery, they began a vigorous research effort to develop carbon nanotube production techniques to produce commercially viable volumes of the material for patentable applications designed to exploit their extraordinary properties. &#8220;This development provides impetus for the technical textiles and specialty materials sector in Australia.&#8221; Dr Peter Binks CEO Nanotechnology Victoria In 2005, the CSIRO/UTD team demonstrated that synthetically made carbon nanotubes can be commercially manufactured into transparent sheets that are stronger than steel sheets of the same weight. These carbon nanotube materials have a number of potential applications in, for example, organic light emitting displays, electronic sensors, artificial muscles and broad-band polarized light sources that can be switched in one ten-thousandth of a second. Award announcement In their announcement, the Nanotechnology Victoria panel endorsed 'the award of A$10,000 for the outstanding application of nanotechnologies in Australia to Mr Ken Atkinson and his team from CSIRO Textile and Fibre Technology, working with the NanoTech Institute, University of Texas at Dallas for carbon nanotube yarns.' Dr Binks, CEO of Nanotechnology Victoria, commented that the development provides impetus for the technical textiles and specialty materials sector in Australia. Over the last decade this sector &#8211; which includes innovative fibres and treatments for sportswear, surfwear, mountaineering equipment, and military apparel &#8211; has defied the gloomy prognosis for manufactured goods in Australia, demonstrating innovation both in products and in marketing of technical performance. The NanoVic Prizes are offered annually to the best entrants in the fields of industrial, postgraduate, and undergraduate nanotechnology development for commercial use. Nanotechnology Victoria&#160;is the leading nanotechnology commercialisation entity in Australia, and the CSIRO is a founding Member.
