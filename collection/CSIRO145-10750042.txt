Caring for our water Water recycling systems Protecting and restoring water quality Caring for our water Water demand is fast outstripping supply in many Australian cities. Climate change and population growth are putting increased pressure on water resources. Many sensitive urban land and water environments are at risk of contamination. Driven by the vision to protect Australia&#8217;s water resources, CSIRO aims to secure safe supplies of water for the future through: encouraging recycling better management of urban catchments remediation of contaminated water resources. Our challenge is to turn stormwater, wastewater and contaminated water into a safe and productive resource for all users. To achieve this we undertake microbiological, socio-economic, health and technological research.&#160; Our challenge is to turn stormwater, wastewater and contaminated water into a safe and productive resource for all users. Water recycling systems Our recycling research identifies and develops emerging technologies for the storage and treatment of water. An important key to sound urban water management is the integration of groundwater resources into the urban water system. This research incorporates health and environmental risk assessment, which is a vital component in community engagement. We also identify key factors in the successful adoption of recycling innovations and the community values associated with them. We evaluate these innovative recycling systems and, where successful, use modelling techniques to integrate them into real and conceptual urban-based water systems. In this work, CSIRO is committed to developing methods to ensure safe adoption of recycling systems. Protecting and restoring water quality Our remediation research focuses on a series of investigations; from understanding the behaviour of contaminants through to knowledge of their impact or beneficial use.&#160;By working with industry, government and other research providers, we develop scientific solutions for the assessment and treatment of contaminated environments. The outcomes assist in water protection and water quality policy by providing sound advice on the management and prevention of contamination threats.
