Specialist skills irrigation scienceOur researchers are using their skills to explore the relationships between irrigation systems and surrounding catchments, including the links between supply, allocation, productivity and ground water, and identify opportunities for integrated use of surface and groundwater. Textile processing for every stage of productionBusinesses large and small, Australian and overseas, routinely use CSIRO's fibre and textile processing facilities for small batches that require custom processing conditions. Partnership   Broad support for cotton textiles programCSIRO is working with the cotton industry in Australia and around the world to improve the quality and value of Australian cotton. Partnering for high quality cottonCSIRO and Cotton Seed Distributors Ltd (CSD) work together to provide high quality cotton varieties for Australian cotton growers.   Service   Textile processing and manufacturing servicesCSIRO offers a textile processing and manufacturing research and development service through its pilot-scale textile mill.
