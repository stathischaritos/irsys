Current activities&#160; Background Academic qualifications&#160; Current activities Dr Nigel Johnson&#160;was appointed&#160;the&#160;Chief of CSIRO Textiles &amp; Fibre Technology in November 2005. CSIRO Textile&#160;&amp; Fibre Technology, based in Belmont, Geelong, Victoria,&#160;delivers programs on wool, cotton and a range of new materials, including world class science in: nanotechnology carbon nanotube yarns conductive polymers smart textiles medical textiles advanced fibres. Dr Johnson champions research with useable outcomes. He sees his role as stimulating and facilitating his colleagues to produce brilliantly useful science. He&#160;believes the fibre and textile industries have entered a new era. The performance of traditional products, such as apparel and furnishings, will be enhanced, and advanced flexible materials with totally new properties will find uses in many sectors. Dr Johnson says thin, flexible textiles could have much to offer in the solution of problems tackled in many areas of research. Intelligent textiles, integrating electronic sensing and communication functions in a wearable form have great potential. Truly intelligent textiles can sense and then respond to changed conditions. 'Researchers in other sectors might not recognise the possibilities offered by the new generation of textiles, so I&#8217;m keen to promote a wider awareness of what modern textiles can do in the 21st century,' he says. He also encourages investigations of non-traditional uses for wool, since it is one of the most sophisticated bio-materials known. 'The wool fibre has a complex internal and surface structure. Each fibre zone has unique chemical and physical properties, offering opportunities to create new functions not possible in manufactured materials. We must continue to exploit this remarkable fibre,' he says. Background Dr Johnson joined CSIRO in 2005 after a distinguished career with Canesis Network in New Zealand as Deputy CEO and General Manager of the Textiles Division. &#8220;Thin, flexible, durable textiles have many uses beyond traditional roles in clothing and furnishings.&#8221; Dr Nigel Johnson, Chief, CSIRO Textile&#160;&amp; Fibre Technology Initially employed after graduating at Ilkleyin, in&#160;the&#160;UK, by the International Wool Secretariat, he returned to&#160;Australia as a lecturer in Textile Technology at the University of NSW, Sydney,&#160;before joining the Wool Research Organisation of New Zealand (WRONZ). Dr Johnson took progressively more senior roles at WRONZ during its transition from a New Zealand-based Incorporated Society to the now fully commercialised organisation Canesis Network, with operations in New Zealand, Europe, USA and China. Academic qualifications A graduate in Textile Physics from the University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia, Dr Johnson completed a PhD in spinning research at Leeds University, in the UK.
