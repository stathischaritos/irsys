The intent of this clip is to show the postural flexibility and ability to repeatedly play performance parts with the CSIRO wearable tambourine instrument shirt. &#8220;Developing the objectless instruments was a technical challenge for precision textile-based sensing.&#8221; Dr Richard Helmer Research engineer CSIRO Textile &amp; Fibre Technology The textile motion sensors used by the instrument for monitoring elbow movements are clearly visible in this clip (black sleeve located on the elbows) and the sensors are connected by wires to the PC interface (not shown). Mr Thorsten Karrer plays a simple moderately paced tambourine rhythm with occasional accents that simulate a tambourine being shaken and also tapped for accent. He first plays the invisible instrument held in front of him with occasional taps at waist height side on to the camera. He is later shown standing front on playing the instrument below waist height and tapping it on his lower thigh. He finishes by 'throwing the instrument down'.
