Helping China re-vegetate the Loess PlateauA CSIRO developed tool is helping China's land and water resource managers rehabilitate an important water catchment and helping to secure China's environmental future. Improved process and design of groundwater remediation systemsCSIRO research has significantly improved the process and design of remediation systems using air sparging and multiphase extraction to treat fuel spills that contaminate groundwater systems. Saving fire-fighters from the Deadman ZoneBushfire fighters are now better trained to avoid the 'Deadman Zone' thanks to a CSIRO study of bushfire behaviour which has identified a fire's critical warning signs.   Audio   Protecting your home from bushfire (Podcast 27 Sep 06)Mr Justin Leonard discusses ways you can prepare your home against bushfires in this seven-minute interview. Capability   Improving fire safety, control and preventionCSIRO has a range of fire research, testing and consulting services that form our integrated fire safety capability used in safety design, developing fire-safe materials and improving public safety. Understanding bushfire behaviour to save livesAlthough bushfires are notoriously unpredictable, CSIRO scientists have the ability to develop reliable tools for predicting fire behaviour which may save lives and help to limit damage. Fact Sheet   Disaster and emergency response focus for new centre fact sheetThe NSWFB will contribute its expertise in fire fighting, emergency management, and community safety education and training. CSIRO will contribute research facilities, resources and expertise in fire science and emergency management. Farming Ahead: CSIRO and related articles from 2007Farming Ahead magazine regularly features CSIRO and related research for the agricultural sector. This is a list of articles published in the magazine throughout 2007. Feature Article   Climate change impacts on fire weatherThe combined frequencies of days with very high and extreme Forest Fire Danger Index ratings are likely to increase. Media Release   Daily updates to assess Great Barrier Reef bleaching (Media release 5 Mar 07)A new tool has been developed which provides daily updates of the risk of ‘coral bleaching’ in the Great Barrier Reef and other reefs in the Coral Sea. Disaster and emergency response focus for new centre (Media release 28 Nov 05)Australia will be better prepared to deal with disasters – natural or man-made – through a new centre dedicated to minimising the impact of emergencies on the community. Solid fence offers protection during bushfire experiments (Media release 21 Dec 05)A solid steel or hardwood fence provides better protection against bushfire attack than that of treated pine or open slatted fences, according to research experiments conducted by the Bushfire Cooperative Research Centre and CSIRO. Space scientists to take the Earth’s pulse (Media release 8 Mar 07)Dozens of international satellite and modelling experts are meeting in Canberra today to discuss how to improve observations of the Earth to better understand and predict climate change, water availability, and natural disasters. Using two cultures to manage Kakadu’s wetlands (Media release 17 Jun 05)“You look after country, and the country will look after you,” says Violet Lawson, a traditional owner from Kakadu National Park.  Weeding out the risk of pest plants (Media release 8 Mar 07)More accurate assessments of the environmental risks associated with the release of disease-resistant plants are now possible following CSIRO’s development of a new framework that identifies potential weed pests. Overview   Bushfires overviewAustralian scientists aim to save lives and limit damage to property through  research and the development of technologies for predicting bushfire behaviour. Ensis overviewThe combined resources of Australia’s and New Zealand’s pre-eminent forest research organisations have united to form a world-leading joint venture, known as Ensis. Overview - Research   Environmental biogeochemistry: protecting our land and water resourcesTo support the maintenance and protection of Australia’s land and water resources, we provide clients with science-based solutions to predict and manage the risks posed by environmental contaminants. Gene technology: risk assessmentCSIRO found that genetically modified subterranean clover is not a greater weed risk than its non-GM counterpart. Understanding the science of fireCSIRO’s Fire Science research program uses our expertise in material flammability, fire growth and control, and bushfire impact on infrastructure to improve fire safety. Overview - Science   Fire safety and control overviewOur expertise with fire science and technology has delivered a track record in innovating fire safety design, developing fire-safe materials and improving public safety.Profile - Facility   CSIRO Black Mountain quarantine facility (ACT)CSIRO Entomology’s quarantine facility provides a secure working environment for research on exotic insects, plants and pathogens. Profile - Location   Alice Springs: Centre for Arid Zone Research (NT)CSIRO’s Centre for Arid Zone Research is conducting research into regional futures, indigenous livelihoods, conservation planning and management, sustainable agricultural systems and knowledge management for arid rangelands. Darwin: CSIRO Tropical Ecosystems Research Centre (NT)The CSIRO Tropical Ecosystems Research Centre (TERC) in Darwin, Northern Territory, serves as a focus for research in the seasonal tropics of northern Australia.
