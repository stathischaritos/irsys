Up: Data Previous: The General Nature of the Data for AIPS++ User-Oriented Data Organization From the point of view of the user the highest level identification of
the problem is what we will call a ``project''. Projects are aimed at
obtaining answers to scientific questions. Answers to these
scientific questions frequently involve obtaining data from a variety
of telescopes. Some projects require radio data from both single dish
and array observations from the same or different instruments, each
serving a different ``purpose''.
Observations for each instrument are organized into observing ``runs''
with sequences of ``scans'' with identical instrumental and observing
parameters. Each scan contains
``sub-scans'' with data elements in the form of spectra, time
instances of coherence function data or spectra, etc., that are
associated with instances of time. Astronomers need to deal with
this hierarchy of data: project, purpose, instrument, observing run, scans, and
sub-scans. It would be very helpful if the astronomer could be aided in dealing with things
according to this hierarchy. Data that are viewed as simple sequences
of data from stand-alone telescopes
leave the astronomer to impose a mental image of
project/instrument/purposes and then runs/scans on the simple data elements. The future mmA will
be a case where the same instrument will generate both
single dish and coherence function data sets. This makes it a prime
example where the same instrument will serve diverse instrumental purposes
for a wide variety of ``projects''. In this document we list preparation for observing as an AIPS++ task.
This is partly because simulation, using
AIPS++ processing tools, can be very useful in understanding an
observing program during the planning and preparation process. In
addition, it is at this stage that the user imposes the logic of
project/instrument/purposes/runs/scans on the observing process, and this logic
must be remembered and used as part of the data reduction and
processing. If tools were available in AIPS++ to aid the user in
passing on and using this logic all the way through data processing,
it would be very helpful. It would be analogous to having and
updating the map of a maze that can be used while passing through the
maze. Data processing is very much like a maze to be negotiated for
most astronomers, and assistance in dealing with the higher level
purposes of data would be very useful. The above can be describe more technically by saying that data
sets should have a hierarchy of descriptor (or ``header'') items, with
descriptor items being identified by context information (such as
name, position, etc., for images). These data descriptors should allow
specification ranging very large, merged data sets to basic elements
like pixels or u-v data points. It should be possible to eliminate
redundancy by describing information on a sufficiently high level
while allowing exceptions by overriding this information at a lower
level; that is, mixtures of positive and negative data/information specifications.
