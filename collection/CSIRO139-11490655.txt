Research to tackle the issues Why focus on water? The Water for Healthy Country Flagship focuses on water, its uses and values. Our goal is to achieve a tenfold increase in the social, economic and environmental benefits from water by 2025. Our scientists are developing the knowledge and technologies needed to: protect our rural and urban landscapes and ecosystems provide safe and clean drinking water manage our rivers, wetlands and estuaries ensure the sustainable use of our precious water resources. Research to tackle the issues Water for a Healthy Country is taking a systematic approach working in four regions that represent a diversity of issues and opportunities for water resource science across Australia: Great Barrier Reef Catchments: safeguarding the Reef River Murray region: supporting a healthy working river Urban waterscapes: creating water smart cities for Australia South-West Western Australia: supporting state water management strategies. These four regions are linked by Australia-wide activities on: Understanding how climate change affects water supply water benefits accounting &amp; assessment, providing a framework to measure and evaluate benefits of water use across Australia. Why focus on water? Australians value the benefits we gain from water, including our: The challenge is how to wring out increased water benefits from Australia&#8217;s limited water resources. healthy rivers, estuaries and wetlands and their rich biodiversity irrigation and rain-fed agriculture supporting rural and regional communities, feeding the nation and gaining export income water-dependent and largely urban lifestyles,&#160; gardens, pools, playing fields, parks and waterways with their recreational, spiritual and amenity value. Sustainable management of our water resources is one of Australia&#8217;s most pressing natural resources issues. The challenge is how to wring out increased water benefits from Australia&#8217;s limited water resources. Demands are increasing &#8211; industry, urban and irrigation &#8211; and at the same time we are all seeking healthy rivers, reefs and fisheries. The Water for a Healthy Country Flagship will provide information and management opportunities to improve the benefits that Australia gains from its water resources. The Flagship will deliver the science required to support governments and water resource managers in making informed decisions for future planning and infrastructure investment. Water for a Healthy Country is a partnership of leading Australian scientists, research institutions, private enterprises, community groups, government and non-government organisations and CSIRO.
