Predicting and reporting for natural resource managementCSIRO is leading the development of modelling technology for natural resource management in Australia and our prediction and reporting technologies will allow natural resource managers to model scenarios digitally and save millions of dollars. Exploring the new physics of the nanoscaleCSIRO’s large, integrated team of professional scientists and engineers research the new physics of the nanoscale. They cover biomimetics, nanoparticle films, biosensor arrays and molecular electronics. Understanding artificial intelligenceWith the development of advanced artificial intelligence technology, CSIRO scientists are taking automated systems process to a new level of capability. Managing complex systemsCSIRO is applying systems and complexity theory to optimise the performance and efficiency of market areas such as manufacturing, mining, infrastructure, logistics and security. Utilising remote sensing dataCSIRO develops applications that make use of remote sensing data to help spot bushfires in remote areas, predict the weather and map land, vegetation and oceans. Driving improvements in oil and gas productionCSIRO delivers science solutions vital to a globally competitive and sustainable energy industry with a primary focus on oil, gas and geothermal energy resources. Creating machines that sense and respondOur expertise combining intelligent sensors and computing leads to machines and products that can interact with their environment and alter the way they function. Giving machines visionCSIRO’s Machine Vision team is expanding the capabilities of visioning hardware-software, building machines able to automatically process images in real-world conditions. Service   Robotics student workshop (Northern Territory)Teach something else to do your work for you. CSIRO runs an interactive robotics program for students in Years 3-6 in the Northern Territory . Strontium Isotope Stratigraphy serviceCSIRO’s Strontium Isotope Stratigraphy (SIS) provides greater chronostratigraphic control of basin evolution, which is important for petroleum exploration. QGF and QGF-E serviceThese techniques allow us to understand hydrocarbon migration and accumulation. It detects current and palaeo-oil zones by measuring the intensity of fluorescence from ultraviolet light-excited hydrocarbons sealed in fluid inclusions and at the surface of siliciclastic rocks.Grains with Oil Inclusions (GOI™) serviceGrains with Oil Inclusions (GOI™) is a petrographic technique for identifying palaeo-oil zones in clastic rocks. It allows us to understand petroleum movement in the subsurface. Frequency of Oil Inclusions (FOI) serviceThe FOI technique is used for oil exploration to detect oil migration and accumulation in carbonate petroleum systems. It allows us to understand the history of oil accumulation. Resistivity from oil-water inclusions (ROI™) serviceResistivity from Oil-water Inclusions (ROI™) is a technique used by CSIRO for the petroleum industry to determine water saturation in oil reservoirs. Total scanning fluorescence (TSF) serviceTotal scanning fluorescence (TSF) is a technique that provides fluorescence fingerprints for oil, surface and oil inclusion extracts from rock samples. It provides an accurate method to detect the presence of crude oils in the drilling process and in distinguishing crude oil from contaminants in drilling cuttings. Solution   Locating bushfires as they happenSentinel Hotspots provides reliable 'eyes' in the sky for Emergency Services, using satellite images to locate and map bushfires occurring in Australia and providing the information to anyone on the internet. Putting remote sensing on the mapCSIRO and the Australian Greenhouse Office have developed remote sensing tools and technologies that allow Australia to accurately measure land cover change over the past 30 years. Safe-T-Cam: keeping an eye on the roadCSIRO-developed automated imaging technology is finding many uses, including helping traffic authorities monitor heavy vehicles on the highway. Automated detection of road cracksCSIRO’s automated road sensing system, RoadCrack, is able to find cracks in road paving down to a width of one millimetre at high speeds, reducing the cost and increasing the accuracy of road crack detection.   National Research FlagshipsFind out about the Flagship Program Site Map Using this Site Legal Notice and Disclaimer Privacy Copyright Last updated: 16 March 2007
