Overview Sustainable development&#160;&#160; An integrated approach Our partners Overview CSIRO provides industry and researchers with knowledge to help create policy that enhances sustainability. We develop new theory and techniques to produce innovative decision-making processes and solutions for Australia&#8217;s major land and water problems. These include: the design of water markets potential uses of recycled water analysis of the potential effects of incentives and behaviour change on water usage analysis of alternative systems of governance to enhance water management outcomes. This work integrates social, economic and policy research with that of biophysical disciplines. Sustainable development To achieve sustainable environmental decision-making we need to understand how current decisions affect our beneficial management of land and water resources in the long term. By integrating social and economic considerations, ecologically sustainable development can occur. Our challenge is to integrate social and economic knowledge to create policy that enhances sustainability. A current focus of research is the study of the changes in behaviour of landholders and their water use as a result of policies or incentives. For example, landholders respond to policies and incentives in a variety of ways depending on factors such as: personal values attitude to risk financial resources the nature of property rights. This provides a challenge to predicting behaviours. CSIRO combines insights from a variety of approaches to social and economic research to provide informed evaluation of the outcomes of such alternatives.&#160; Integrated approach Through our two national groups, the Australian Research Centre for Water in Society (ARCWIS) and the Policy and Economic Research Unit (PERU), the Society, Economy and Policy (SEP) team conducts research to: improve the quality of decision-making for land and water issues - this is achieved through social analysis and then by integrating&#160; this with sustainable decision making processes develop and apply economic methods to enable better management of natural resources - this is done through leading work in economics and policy analysis and by drawing on existing knowledge both from within CSIRO and other research agencies help improve land and water management, decision making and policy by following a coherent process, from developing an understanding of social, institutional and policy frameworks through to implementing viable options in conjunction with stakeholders. Our partners Our research projects draw on existing knowledge within CSIRO and other agencies to develop potential solutions which combine policy, economic management, social analysis and sound science. CSIRO works closely with partners from Commonwealth, State and Local Government agencies. These include regulatory bodies such as the catchment management authorities. We also work with private industry, both in Australia and internationally.
