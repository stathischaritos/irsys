Achievement   Helping China re-vegetate the Loess PlateauA CSIRO developed tool is helping China's land and water resource managers rehabilitate an important water catchment and helping to secure China's environmental future. Capability   Assessing development sustainabilityUnderstanding the complex interactions between population, resource use and the environment is a difficult task in scenario modelling, but CSIRO is helping Australia find the right path for future sustainable development. Assisting smart water policy designMixing science with economics for smart policy options, CSIRO researchers provide new options for land and water management. This work involves industry, social scientists, physical scientists and policy makers. Creating urban sustainabilityCSIRO is developing a broad range of tools to assist governments and industry revitalise Australia’s cities, meet emerging challenges and transition to a sustainable configuration. Protecting our water resourcesCSIRO’s Water Resources Protection team can conduct research into water quality, contaminant dynamics, microbial processes and industrial biotechnology to assist in the management and protection of urban and industrial water resources. Event: Conference   XXIII International Congress of EntomologyCSIRO scientists will join colleagues at the XXIII International Congresses of Entomology (ICE 2008) in July 2008 to discuss developments in the diverse field of entomology. Fact Sheet   An interesting native wasp: black flower waspBlack flower wasps are large, solitary native wasps with iridescent blue wings. The females burrow into the soil to lay their eggs on beetle larvae. They are not pests. Common paper wasps fact sheetCommon paper wasp nests occur around the home hanging from eaves, pergolas or vegetation. Adult wasps will defend their nest and can sting repeatedly if threatened or when the nest is disturbed.  Media Release   Darwin expert to head national water-use project (Media release 19 Oct 06)CSIRO has welcomed the appointment of Darwin-based water resources expert, Ian Lancaster, as the new head of a national research effort working to help ensure a sustainable future for northern Australia. New standards in water-sensitive urban development (Media release 18 Oct 06)The Water for a Healthy Country Flagship has played a key role in the development of Western Australia’s largest master planned urban development.
