Balancing forestry outcomesCSIRO scientists have the expertise to advise on the siting of new tree plantations to ensure they deliver net benefits to the environment. Improving manufacturing systemsCSIRO is helping manufacturers compete globally by improving the flexibility and efficiency of their management, operations and manufacturing processes. Integrating urban infrastructure and systemsCSIRO offers urban infrastructure technology to governments, global industry leaders and international bodies to help tackle the complex challenges they face in managing their transport, buildings, utilities and telecommunications infrastructure. Managing complex systemsCSIRO is applying systems and complexity theory to optimise the performance and efficiency of market areas such as manufacturing, mining, infrastructure, logistics and security. Managing insect pests and weedsCSIRO has a history of biological control successes and our scientists are using their expertise to find more natural enemies of introduced weeds and insect pests.Understanding artificial intelligenceWith the development of advanced artificial intelligence technology, CSIRO scientists are taking automated systems process to a new level of capability.
