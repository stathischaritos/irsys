Our challenge is to deliver the science needed to achieve this in partnership with communities, industries, governments, land users and land managers. The Program operates primarily in the tropical to sub-tropical region of north-east Australia. This region has special characteristics that help to focus the research agenda: Tropical Landscapes Regional Labs: Townsville Lab (Davies) Atherton Lab (TFRC) Project Web Sites: Rodent Management Sustainable Landscape Planning in the Wet Tropics More Projects: Integrated Landscape Management Tropical Biodiversity Sustaining Ecosystem Services Vertebrate Management Sustainable Production Efficient Industries Resources, Publications:Field methods for rodent studies in Asia and the Indo-Pacific CSE Research Programs Agricultural Landscapes Rangelands and Savannas Resource Futures a very high diversity of plants, animals and habitats; four World Heritage areas with their associated management challenges; widespread intensive agriculture in co-existence with areas of forest and coastal wetlands needing protection; and increasing environmental pressure from agricultural development, urban and peri-urban expansion and tourism. The Program is based at CSIRO Sustainable Ecosystems offices in Atherton, Brisbane, Cairns and Townsville and has a focus on integrated landscape management, biodiversity, vertebrate management, sustaining ecosystem processes, sustainable intensive production systems and efficient industries in tropical and sub-tropical regions.
