CSIRO is working on a range of innovative new materials, products and manufacturing techniques to support Australia’s globally competitive industries.CSIRO&#8217;s Manufacturing and Materials Technology division develops innovative technology solutions that support Australia&#8217;s manufacturing and infrastructure industries and address issues of national significance such as energy, water, security, transport and sustainability.&#160; Our research offers environmental, economic and social benefits both locally and globally and can specifically benefit industry by delivering competitive advantage, creating new markets and driving growth. We also work with a number of the world&#8217;s leading companies.&#160;For example, we are world-renowned for our new material and coatings work that has helped Boeing develop even better aircraft shells. The division has a large intellectual property stable and is granted numerous patents each year. We have a strong track record in the commercial application of great science and technology transfer, including the development of: Magnesium sheet technology &#8211; cost-effective manufacturing of very thin and high quality light metal sheets. Safe-T-cam - an automated monitoring system that uses digital camera technology to read the number plates of moving vehicles. Oxymix - a medical device that provides premature babies with the right mix of air and oxygen. Ultraviolet stabilisers &#8211; nanometre-sized coatings being used in a range of products, including timber varnishes and sunscreens. Our research offers environmental, economic and social benefits for the nation and can specifically benefit industry by delivering competitive advantage, creating new markets and driving growth. New technologies lead to the establishment of new industries - our science has resulted in the successful start-up of several companies including: Plantic (biodegradable packaging) HySSIL (lightweight concrete) XRT Limited (X-ray imaging machines). By partnering with industry and engaging with other research organisations and universities, we can provide technological solutions through the application of highly focussed scientific research.&#160; Our research areas that capitalise on our multidisciplinary skill base to address industry needs and key national challenges include: Manufacturing Technologies for Transport. This research aims to develop new technologies for the transport sector in the areas of vehicle safety, comfort and durability; reuse and recycling of vehicle materials; and reducing vehicle manufacturing lead times. Innovative Material, Polymer and Composite Technologies. New nanocomposites and polymer materials will significantly transform the transport, packaging and biomedical industries. These materials will be smaller, lighter, stronger, and have the ability to perform a number of concurrent functions. Adaptive and Extreme Process Technologies. New high-value technologies will help the oil, gas, chemical and minerals processing markets become more efficient.&#160; The key challenges in these markets are for more intense, cost-effective, maintenance-free and sustainable processes. Technologies for Safeguarding Australia&#8217;s Critical Infrastructure. This research aims to develop new technologies that minimise security and natural threats on Australian institutions and lifestyle by protecting critical infrastructure, and by the detection of undesirable intrusions into Australia. Testing and Consulting. CSIRO&#8217;s Industrial Research Services Group provides the manufacturing, building and construction industries with comprehensive and accredited testing, consulting and appraisal services.
