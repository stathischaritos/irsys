The challenge Project summary What CSIRO has done Outcomes The challenge Water pollution is a significant issue for many small island nations with fringing reefs. The environmental and social impacts are recognised but rarely quantified in economic terms. Project summary In this project, the Cook Islands Government and the South Pacific Regional Environment Program (SPREP) engaged CSIRO to estimate the economic impacts of water pollution to Rarotonga, the largest of the islands in the Cook Islands nation, in both area and population. There was a capacity building component to this study to ensure new skills were transferred and retained by the people of the&#160;Cook Islands. The most significant costs to the community of the Cook islands include:&#160; loss of tourism, purchase of bottled water and costs of water-related illness. Currently, like in most Pacific island countries, Rarotonga has no chemical water treatment.&#160; Coarse gravel filters remove leaves etc from the water but do not filter out bacteria.&#160; As a result, the quality of tap water falls below international safety standards for drinking and locals and tourists are advised to boil their drinking water. What CSIRO has done In 2005, CSIRO estimated that sound watershed management could save the community of the Cook Islands millions of dollars that are being spent dealing with the consequences of water pollution. The project estimated that currently, water pollution in Rarotonga costs the Cook Islands in the vicinity of NZ$3.2 to NZ$17.7 million per year, with a best estimate of NZ$7.4 million per year. The figure of NZ$7.4 million, a best estimate between a low estimate of NZ$3.2 million and high estimate of NZ$17.6 million,&#160;translates to NZ$2&#160;900 per household. Estimated economic impacts included: healthcare and illness costs downstream household water filters upstream public water filters household rainwater tanks bottled water purchases mosquito control loss of fish stocks in lagoon water pipe upgrades lost tourism income. Although these costs can&#8217;t be eliminated entirely, the introduction of sound watershed management practices could reduce them significantly. The study was based on a cost savings and avoidance (CSA) methodology. It used information gathered from: government reports surveys of Rarotongan residents and tourists estimates supplied by government and industry staff. Outcomes Effective management of watersheds will require a combined government, industry and community response on: soil erosion and stream sedimentation herbicide and pesticide run-off fertiliser run-off livestock and animal waste septic tank leakage mosquito outbreaks from stream blockage and poor waste disposal liquid and solid waste disposal.
