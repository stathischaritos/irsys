Achievement   Augusta-Margaret River: science and local knowledge for sustainabilityThe Augusta-Margaret River region of Western Australia is celebrated for its wine, food, creative industries, surf, and natural beauty – and the local shire council is partnering with science to ensure it stays that way. Catalyst futures: helping sustainable planning on the NSW Central CoastThe recent Catalyst futures project has revealed the complexities of managing change in a rapidly urbanising community close to two growing cities, Sydney and Newcastle, on the eastern seaboard of Australia. Catchment Modelling ToolkitThe Catchment Modelling Toolkit website provides a 'one-stop shop' to improve the standard of land and water modelling in Australia. Future use of Sunshine Coast sugarcane landscapesA report detailing CSIRO research that assesses rural land use options is helping with tough decisions facing sugar farmers and planners on the Queensland Sunshine coast. Improved process and design of groundwater remediation systemsCSIRO research has significantly improved the process and design of remediation systems using air sparging and multiphase extraction to treat fuel spills that contaminate groundwater systems. Model solutions to Great Barrier Reef problemsFlagship scientists have developed a model to assist in the management of excessive erosion, sediments and nutrients in Great Barrier Reef catchments. Murrumbidgee water savingsCSIRO researchers have been establishing the amount of water in the Murrumbidgee Catchment; where it is economically feasible to save water, where the water is going, and how much of it is being lost to evaporation and seepage. New classifications system for marine bioregionsIn 2005-06, the National Marine Bioregionalisation of Australia provided a framework for classifying Australia’s marine environment into bioregions relevant to their physical environment and ecological communities. New stock assessment techniques for the Northern Prawn FisheryNew data and innovative modelling technology have led to more accurate stock assessments for the Northern Prawn Fishery. New way to accurately count fishUsing sound waves, researchers have found a way to greatly improve the accuracy of measuring fish numbers in the murky River Murray.
