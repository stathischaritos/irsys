Creating hybrid materialsCSIRO is blending disparate materials to create products with fire and UV resistance or to introduce high levels of corrosion resistance, adhesive properties and biodegradability. Exploring the new physics of the nanoscaleCSIRO’s large, integrated team of professional scientists and engineers research the new physics of the nanoscale. They cover biomimetics, nanoparticle films, biosensor arrays and molecular electronics. Exploring applications for carbon nanotubesCSIRO is looking at the industrialisation of the spinning process to utilise nanotubes which create textiles that can conduct heat and electricity. Partnership   CSIRO and DataDot working in partnershipCSIRO and DataDot Technology Ltd collaborate to create a 50/50 joint venture — DataTraceDNA — to market a groundbreaking approach to counterfeit security protection through nanotechnology that is invisibly embedded within a product’s molecular structure. CSIRO and Boeing's relationship goes from strength to strengthWhat began as a series of contract research projects has since evolved into a strategic collaboration delivering complementary benefits to both organisations. CSIRO and Boeing are now working together on opportunities for both organisations in the global market. Spinning a bullet-proof yarnCarbon fibres are being spun into yarns that conduct heat and electricity, and have the potential to produce a new generation of intelligent textiles. CSIRO is working with universities in Australia and the USA to develop these fibres into commercial products.
