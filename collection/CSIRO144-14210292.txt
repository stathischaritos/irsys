CSIRO is working toward its sustainable use and management. Our coastal issues Addressing the issues The science involved Our coastal issues Australians value their coastal marine resources and ecosystems highly. However, Australia's marine ecosystems are subjected to unprecedented and rapidly growing pressures, such as: rapid coastal population growth and development catchment land and water use marine industries (shipping, tourism, aquaculture, oil and gas extraction, tourism and fishing) pollution introduced exotic species coastal infrastructure development climate change extreme weather events. Addressing the issues The goal of CSIRO&#8217;s Integrated Coastal and Oceans Management (ICOM) research theme is to ensure sustainable development, use, enjoyment and conservation of Australia's coastal and ocean marine ecosystems and biodiversity. CSIRO aims to achieve this by: assessing, understanding and predicting the response of marine ecosystems to interacting pressures science-based planning, monitoring and management of multiple human uses of marine ecosystems. We are also working with various agencies and groups at local, state and Australian Government levels, to develop and apply the necessary systems and tools. 'Approximately 86 per cent of Australians live in the coastal zone and value coastal recreation and tourism, resources and conservation' Dr John Parslow, CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research. These are needed to responsibly manage coastal and marine development for economic and social benefit, while maintaining the environment and our high quality of life. The science involved The science of ICOM is based around the development of solutions through sophisticated systems approaches to assessing and predicting the response of marine ecosystems to anthropogenic (human)&#160;and natural pressures. This requires the integration of laboratory experiments, field studies and mathematical modelling techniques, spanning physical, chemical, physiological and ecological disciplines, with strong links to social, economic and institutional sciences through partnerships with other organisations. The research being undertaken by the ICOM research theme covers four main areas: Conservation and biodiversity. This&#160;will determine threats to marine biodiversity including climate change, habitat loss and invasive species, and evaluate alternative management responses. National ecosystem-based management. This&#160;will develop generic techniques and tools for regional marine planning and sustainable multiple-use management. Two major regional and local case studies examining coasts from eastern and western Australia. These will develop and apply the science and tools to underpin sustainable management of coastal development, industries, resources and biodiversity.
