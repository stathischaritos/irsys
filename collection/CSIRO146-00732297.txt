 Return to normal viewCommonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research OrganisationAutomated road camera technology is helping create safer highways.Transport systems overviewCSIRO is developing computing and sensing technologies for monitoring vehicle components, freight, traffic, transport infrastructure and transport operators.CSIRO develops transport monitoring systems through the use of advanced computing, communications, electronics and sensing technologies. These systems may be used to monitor transport and or have various applications towards improving transport management and operational efficiencies. When integrated into transportation infrastructure and/or vehicles, these monitoring technologies can assist in creating efficiencies such as: enhanced safety and security improved environmental quality reduced vehicle emissions reduced vehicle operating costs travel time savings. CSIRO is actively involved in the development of transport monitoring systems through the use of advanced computing, communications, electronics and sensing technologies. Our areas of research include: automatic imaging technologies to monitor cars and trucks on roads and highways computer vision technologies for monitoring aircraft movement on runways decision making tools to improve the safety and efficiency of air traffic management operations imaging technologies to survey the integrity of road pavements internet-based radio-frequency identification systems for improving the tracking and tracing of freight ocean forecasting systems for predicting maritime conditions robotic vision technologies&#160; sensors and software to provide in-flight information on aerospace vehicle and operator performance structural health management systems.
