ISBN 0 643 05151 1 Many species of timber can be attacked by wood-destroying insects such as wood borers and termites. With some species of wood borer or termite, an infestation can result in serious economic damage necessitating treatment and repair or replacement of the affected timber. With other species, remedial action is unnecessary. In many situations, preventive measures can significantly reduce the damage caused by these wood-destroying insects. This book provides architects, engineers, builders, foresters, members of the pest control and timber industries, and the general public with a ready source of reference to the more important wood borers and termites encountered in Australia.

ISBN 0 975 02061 7 The phytophagous thrips associated with Australian Acacia include over 250 species in 30 genera, of which 140 species and nine genera are here newly described. They include gall-inducers, species that glue phyllodes together, parasites of these two types of domicile-formers, and opportunistic species using old domiciles or other microhabitats. The causes and consequences of this behavioural-ecological diversification are explored, with special emphasis on how this study has provided insights into the evolution of social behaviour, of host-plant use, and of exploitative behaviours.

Wire bound paperback. ISBN 0 642 56836 7 Damage from heavy lerp infestations on eucalypts is a familiar sight to most Australians, but few are aware of the insects that cause this damage. The beautifully shaped sugary lerps that cover these insects were well known to Aboriginal Australians, who collected them as a source of food. Psylloid insects are of special interest as pests and potential biological control agents in agriculture, horticulture and forestry. They are of concern in biosecurity and quarantine, as well as to foresters and natural resource managers.

The flightless Phasmodinae feed on flowers in heath habitats in Western Australia. The Zaprochilinae also feed on flowers, and appear to play a role in pollination. Many species have been collected only recently, probably because of their appearance in late winter and early spring. The Austrosaginae is a group of flightless mostly predatory katydids, many of which have limited distributions and may be of conservation concern. There are contributions from D. H. Colless on numerical classification, and from N. Ueshima on karyotypes and meiosis.

POSTERS CSIRO produces a range of posters with entomological subjects, which are suitable for home or educational use. Posters are 600 x 800 mm, printed on heavy duty high gloss paper. Eight posters are presently available. Insect Camouflage Many insects obtain protection from predators by adopting colours and shapes that resemble their background. This camouflage or crypsis is here demonstrated by examples from grasshoppers, moths, bugs, and stick insects. Soil Animals Healthy soil contains a rich fauna of small invertebrate animals. Many of them feed on dead plant material, and play an important part in the maintenance of soil fertility. Others are predators, feeding on other small animals. The animals illustrated here are springtails, mites, insects and arachnids. Moths of Wingham Brush Nature Reserve The Wingham Brush Nature Reserve is an 8 hectare remnant of rainforest on the Manning River, near Taree, NSW. It contains a very rich insect fauna, including the 147 species of moths that are illustrated and identified in this poster. Australian Spiders Spiders are an important group of predators that feed on insects and other small animals. The poster illustrates and explains some of the species that are often encountered by people, including the redback, huntsman, white-tailed spider, and funnelweb. Worms Worms Worms Earthworms are important soil animals that help to maintain soil fertility. The poster illustrates some native and introduced species of earthworms, with information about their behaviour, life cycle, feeding, and internal anatomy. Australian Insects A general introduction to the amazing diversity of the Australian insect fauna, with spectacular photos and explanatory information on beetles, wasps, bugs, grasshoppers, and many more. Australian Beetles There are thousands of species of beetles in Australia, many of them with spectacular shapes and colours. The jewel beetles, Christmas beetles, giant weevils, and King stag beetle are just a few examples of this rich fauna. Disappearing Insects of Native Grasslands The southern tablelands of NSW were once covered by a mosaic of grassland and grassy woodlands. These native grasslands have been fragmented by urban and agricultural development, and many of the distinctive insects that occur there are threatened with extinction. Posters are $8.00 each plus postage and packing as below. These costs include a mailing tube and the cost of postage based on Australia Post parcel rates.
