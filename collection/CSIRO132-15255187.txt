Nonwoven textile research facilities at Geelong, VictoriaCSIRO’s modern nonwoven production mill produces small samples, and also allows product development on pilot scale equipment. Fibre bonding is achieved by chemical or heat treatment, needlepunch or hydroentanglement. Instrument and machine prototypingCSIRO's instrument and machine prototyping team combines with our engineering workshop to rapidly prototype and modify instruments for a range of projects and industry needs. Advanced fibrous materials: lighter, stronger, smarterAdvanced materials improve the design and fabrication of products, introducing new qualities such as biodegradability, thermal and electrical conductivity, high-strength, flexibility and fire resistance. Prototype engineering workshopCSIRO's experience with toolmaking and fine machining enables us to customize tooling and manual programming to suit the most complex needs. It's not rocket science... it's rockin' scienceWearable intelligent textiles, incorporating electronic circuitry and sensors, are well suited to become the basis of the next generation of control systems for many applications of mobile computing, allowing complete freedom of movement. Textile processing for every stage of productionBusinesses large and small, Australian and overseas, routinely use CSIRO's fibre and textile processing facilities for small batches that require custom processing conditions. Service   Textile processing and manufacturing servicesCSIRO offers a textile processing and manufacturing research and development service through its pilot-scale textile mill. Solution   Wool filters for use in air-conditioning systemsIn 2005-06, with co-funding from Australian Wool Innovation Ltd, CSIRO has developed an electrostatically charged wool filter medium which achieves high efficiency at remarkably low pressure drops or energy consumption.  SiroFAST™ fabric quality assurance systemSiroFAST™ system tests fabrics for compression, bending, extension and dimensional stability.
