Developing better wireless and antenna systemsAs wireless communications become ubiquitous and provide more capabilities, our wireless and antenna systems research aims to deliver new products and services for economic development, national security and sustainability. Training simulation tool for delicate ear surgeryCSIRO researchers are developing a collaborative surgical training tool which could allow a trainee to be guided through a simulated operation in real-time, by a surgeon thousands of kilometres away. Developing technologies which can gather information, learn and adaptCSIRO researchers are developing technologies which can gather information, learn and adapt, then use that information to generate intelligent, goal-directed behaviour – all without human intervention. Increasing the effectiveness of biomedical imagingCSIRO’s biomedical imaging team are working to improve the effectiveness of therapies such as surgery or radiotherapy using information gathered from three dimensional images. Sensor solution for environmental monitoringAn Australian research team has developed a system of wireless sensors to help Queensland horticulturalists better understand and measure micro-climates within a large propagation greenhouse. Giving machines visionCSIRO’s Machine Vision team is expanding the capabilities of visioning hardware-software, building machines able to automatically process images in real-world conditions. Healthcare overcomes the tyranny of distanceBy using existing technologies, the Virtual Critical Care Unit (ViCCU™) has become a tool that solves the problem of how to get specialist critical care into smaller, regional hospitals.Developing advanced networks and applicationsCSIRO develops advanced networking technologies for the next generation of business systems through its research in advanced networking and applications. Developing better tools for information workersCSIRO researchers are developing better tools for information workers. These tools are intelligent, adaptable and allow specialised human knowledge and experience to be seamlessly combined with systematised knowledge.
