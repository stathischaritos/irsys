Helping China re-vegetate the Loess PlateauA CSIRO developed tool is helping China's land and water resource managers rehabilitate an important water catchment and helping to secure China's environmental future. Improved process and design of groundwater remediation systemsCSIRO research has significantly improved the process and design of remediation systems using air sparging and multiphase extraction to treat fuel spills that contaminate groundwater systems. Saving fire-fighters from the Deadman ZoneBushfire fighters are now better trained to avoid the 'Deadman Zone' thanks to a CSIRO study of bushfire behaviour which has identified a fire's critical warning signs.   Audio   Protecting your home from bushfire (Podcast 27 Sep 06)Mr Justin Leonard discusses ways you can prepare your home against bushfires in this seven-minute interview. Capability   Improving fire safety, control and preventionCSIRO has a range of fire research, testing and consulting services that form our integrated fire safety capability used in safety design, developing fire-safe materials and improving public safety. Understanding bushfire behaviour to save livesAlthough bushfires are notoriously unpredictable, CSIRO scientists have the ability to develop reliable tools for predicting fire behaviour which may save lives and help to limit damage. Fact Sheet   Disaster and emergency response focus for new centre fact sheetThe NSWFB will contribute its expertise in fire fighting, emergency management, and community safety education and training. CSIRO will contribute research facilities, resources and expertise in fire science and emergency management. Farming Ahead: CSIRO and related articles from 2007Farming Ahead magazine regularly features CSIRO and related research for the agricultural sector. This is a list of articles published in the magazine throughout 2007. Feature Article   Climate change impacts on fire weatherThe combined frequencies of days with very high and extreme Forest Fire Danger Index ratings are likely to increase.
