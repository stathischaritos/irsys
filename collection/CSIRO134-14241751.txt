Achievement   Helping China re-vegetate the Loess PlateauA CSIRO developed tool is helping China's land and water resource managers rehabilitate an important water catchment and helping to secure China's environmental future. Capability   Assessing development sustainabilityUnderstanding the complex interactions between population, resource use and the environment is a difficult task in scenario modelling, but CSIRO is helping Australia find the right path for future sustainable development. Assisting smart water policy designMixing science with economics for smart policy options, CSIRO researchers provide new options for land and water management. This work involves industry, social scientists, physical scientists and policy makers. Creating urban sustainabilityCSIRO is developing a broad range of tools to assist governments and industry revitalise Australia’s cities, meet emerging challenges and transition to a sustainable configuration. Media Release   Darwin expert to head national water-use project (Media release 19 Oct 06)CSIRO has welcomed the appointment of Darwin-based water resources expert, Ian Lancaster, as the new head of a national research effort working to help ensure a sustainable future for northern Australia. New standards in water-sensitive urban development (Media release 18 Oct 06)The Water for a Healthy Country Flagship has played a key role in the development of Western Australia’s largest master planned urban development. Overview   Population sustainability overviewThe debate on population policy requires clear scientific advice about how our population is likely to affect resources, environmental sustainability, the economy and society. CSIRO researches these areas to predict how population policies may affect our sustainability. Profile - Location   Canberra: Gungahlin Homestead (ACT)The Gungahlin Homestead in the Australian Capital Territory, is an historic site in the north of Canberra that now serves as head office for CSIRO Sustainable Ecosystems. Profile - Project   Allocating environmental funds across regions in QueenslandCSIRO has developed an analysis tool for the Queensland government to enable financial resources to be allocated according to agreed criteria, and indicators of natural resource assets and threats. Allocating funds for environmental programs: investing in catchment management programs in NSWCSIRO’s strategic landscape investment model (SLIM) provides a new tool to make decisions about natural resource investments against a range of objectives over time and space.
