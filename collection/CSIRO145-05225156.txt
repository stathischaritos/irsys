Our research and its aims What we are doing Our partners A knowledge of Australia&#8217;s invertebrate biodiversity is fundamental to managing our ecosystems, both natural and man made. This knowledge base will underpin the sustainable use of Australian biodiversity, as well as help to protect it from invasive species and global change. It is therefore essential to develop an understanding of Australia&#8217;s invertebrate fauna at many levels&#160;&#8722;&#160;overview, classification, evolution, distribution, biology and identification. It is also essential to be able to deliver this information rapidly, to a wide variety of users and in a form that allows it to be useful. To ensure this is done efficiently, new technologies that accelerate the rate of gathering of information on biodiversity and its delivery need to be developed. Our research and its aims CSIRO Entomology&#8217;s research is providing leading edge informatics and systematics science that will enhance our capacity to support the conservation and utilisation of Australia&#8217;s rich invertebrate fauna. Our taxonomic research on biodiversity&#160;complements research on&#160;ecosystem function, natural resource management and informing ecosystem management decisions. Important issues being studied include: the identity and relationships of Australia's insect fauna optimising the management and delivery of biodiversity information the biosecurity impact and invasiveness of invasive species measurable and potential impacts of global change on biodiversity. The end result will be an authoritative and comprehensive platform of biodiversity information. This, in turn, will improve Australia&#8217;s capacity to respond to future biosecurity threats and to conserve biodiversity in environments that are changing and/or under threat. What we are doing New technologies are being developed to facilitate the sharing of knowledge on biodiversity. A critical component of this research is the Australian National Insect Collection (ANIC). The information contained in it underpins our research on invertebrate biodiversity. ANIC is housed at and maintained by CSIRO Entomology and its resources are available to all scientists, Australian and international. Research is targeted in two main areas: documenting, managing and informing sustainable use of Australia's biodiversity through a combination of world class molecular and morphological systematics ways of delivering knowledge on our biodiversity to the biosecurity and ecosystem management sectors, including a dynamic, on-line compendium and a portfolio of informatic tools. Our partners The research is done in collaboration with many other groups including: Cooperative Research Centres (CRCs) Research and Development Corporations (RDCs) Universities Australian Government Departments State Government Departments Global and National initiatives around sharing biodiversity information.
