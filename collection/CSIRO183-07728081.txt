RV Southern Surveyor. Voyage Summary SS 07/2004. Miscellaneous Publication. CSIRO Division of Marine Research. Abstract : This dataset contains the Underway (UWY) data collected on Southern Surveyor voyage SS 07/2004. The voyage took place off the west coast of Tasmania in July and August 2004. This dataset has been processed and is archived within the CSIRO Marine Research Data Centre in Hobart. Additional information regarding this dataset is contained in the voyage plan and voyage summary. The standard Underway (=continuously recorded) dataset from a research voyage includes Navigation (NAV), Sounder (PDR), Thermosalinograph (TSG) and Meteorological (MET) data. NAV data includes GPS (Global Positioning System) measurements of latitude, longitude, ship's direction and speed. MET data may include atmospheric temperature, humidity and pressure, wind speed and direction, and incident radiation intensity. The data are available at 10 second intervals in the NetCDF file, or at five minute intervals in the standard ASCII file.

The voyage has two aims. Firstly, it will further develop acoustic remote sensing methods to help determine the population size, species discrimination and spatial gradients, applied to the dominant acoustic species and their dynamics on the west coast of Tasmania. Secondly, it will provide underpinning observations of the physical and biological environment of the west coast of Tasmania's winter spawning blue grenadier population and the relationship with key canyon features within the region. The research voyage will be part funded by a 3 year collaborative FRDC/CSIRO/ Fishing Industry (Ocean Fresh and Petuna Sealords) project to develop a long-term sustainable observation strategy using industry vessels on the west coast of Tasmania.
