Technical textiles and nonwovens The capability CSIRO's nonwoven production equipment Fibres Products How CSIRO uses it Technical textiles and nonwovens Technical textiles are manufactured primarily for their technical performance and functional properties. Technical textiles are produced by a range of technologies: they can be woven, knitted, braided, or &#8216;nonwoven&#8217;. Nonwovens are not made from yarns. Instead, the fibres are arranged in a uniform web or mat, and then bonded by a variety of techniques for strength and functionality. Bypassing the yarn stage has the advantage of significantly reducing production costs, since the expense of spinning is avoided. Nonwoven products include: &#8220;Nonwoven technical textiles bypass the yarn stage used in traditional textile production, significantly reducing production costs.&#8221; Dr Naill Finn Stream Leader CSIRO Textile &amp; Fibre Technology air filters automotive interior trims carpet underlay collar inserts for shirts food packaging (e.g. meat trays) Formula 1 nose cones office dividers shoe insoles vertical blinds wind turbine blades. Production of nonwovens requires three basic steps: fibre blending web formation using extrusion, airlaid, wet laid or carded web fibre bonding for greater strength and functionality, using thermal, chemical and/or mechanical techniques. The capability Nonwoven production and research at CSIRO&#160;is supported by capabilities in: forming a fibre web by carding and air laying bonding by chemical or heat treatment, needlepunch, or hydroentanglement production of fibres, including bicomponent fibres that can be split into microfibres spun-bond processing, with extrusion of&#160; continuous fibre filaments for immediate assembly into a web, followed by hydroentanglement bonding. CSIRO&#8217;s nonwoven production equipment Our equipment is designed for small volume sample production and higher volume pilot scale production. Fibres We process natural and synthetic fibres from as fine as&#160;one denier. These include specialist fibres, bicomponent, soluble, Kevlar, Nomex etc. Products The products we are able to produce include: filters industrial felts quilting thermal insulation sound insulation automotive nonwoven components medical textiles specialised industrial composites apparel wipes For producing samples we card into web or sliver form: minimum batch weight 40 g webs 0.3 m to 1 m wide minimum web weight 25 g/m2 Airlaid Carding for sample production: 0.4 m wide minimum batch weight 300 g maximum output weight of 2000 g/m2 Bonding methods on the sample line: needle-punching of webs 0.3 m wide hydroentanglement, 0.5 m wide thermal bonding, up to 2 m wide chemical bonding. Pilot scale card / cross-lapper / needlepunch line: from 0.6 m to 2 m wide product weight range 60 to 2500 g/m2 minimum batch weight 30 kg Extruder: a&#160;bicomponent fibre extruder can form part of a spun-bond sample production line. How&#160;CSIRO uses it We use the facilities for product development, processing and instrumentation research, prototyping, and low volume sample production. Technical textile and nonwovens projects&#160;have included: wool blend quilts fibre-reinforced composites wetsuits automotive trims (including hot pressed non-wovens) air filters geotextiles production protective apparel Find out more about how&#160;Industry benefits from technical textile research facilities. &#160;&#160; Fast facts Nonwovens fibres are arranged in a uniform web or mat, and then bonded by a variety of techniques for strength and functionality Production of nonwovens requires fibre blending, web formation using extrusion, airlaid, wet laid or carded web and fibre bonding using thermal, chemical and/or mechanical techniques Primary Contact Dr Niall FinnStream LeaderCSIRO Textile &amp; Fibre TechnologyPhone: 61 3 5246 4831 Fax: 61 3 5246 4057 Email: Niall.Finn&#64;csiro.auLocation Textile &amp; Fibre Technology - BelmontColac RoadBelmont VIC 3216AustraliaTechnology Geelong LaboratoriesPO Box 21Belmont VIC 3216AustraliaRelated Areas Technical Textiles Non-woven Textiles Medical Textiles Textiles CSIRO Textile &amp; Fibre Technology Technical textiles and Nonwoven Association&#160;[external] Related Topics Advanced fibrous materials: lighter, stronger, smarter Wool filters for use in air-conditioning systems Prototype engineering workshop Textile processing for every stage of production &#160;/csiro/content/standard/ps2k0.html/science/ps2k0.html/content/ps2k0.html Site Map Using this Site Legal Notice and Disclaimer Privacy Copyright Last updated: 4 December 2006
