Current activities Academic qualifications&#160; Achievements&#160; Current activities As leader of the Land and Atmosphere research group at CSIRO Marine&#160;and Atmospheric Research (CMAR), Dr Helen Cleugh oversees investigations into the exchanges of water, gases and energy (heat) between the land and the atmosphere. A scientist with CSIRO since 1994, Dr Cleugh says the research has far-reaching implications, from better land and water management to improved urban design. 'The information we obtain provides a better understanding of the local and regional factors affecting agricultural productivity and water use, identifies which landscape types produce greenhouse gases and which absorb them, identifies which land uses consume most water, and also casts light on ways of designing cities&#160;that are more energy and water efficient.' Dr Cleugh led the Australian National Windbreaks Program, which investigated the effect of windbreaks on agricultural productivity and water use (see Cleugh H. 2003.&#160;Rural Industries&#160;Research and Development Corporation.&#160;Publication number 02/059). Dr Cleugh says the research has far-reaching implications, from better land and water management to improved urban design. Through the Water for a Healthy Country Flagship, Dr Cleugh&#8217;s research team also develops and tests coupled urban water and energy use models to explore the links between water and climate-sensitive urban design. CSIRO&#8217;s Land and Atmosphere scientists combine measurements of gases, water and heat exchanges with information from mathematical models of land and air interactions to yield carbon and water budgets in local and regional areas over time periods ranging from single days to several years. In collaboration with colleagues from the United States, CSIRO has recently developed a new method of determining land surface evaporation (ie water use by plants and soil) using remotely-sensed satellite data. Dr Cleugh also leads the Terrestrial Carbon and Water Cycles component of the Australian Climate Change Science Program. CSIRO is a major science provider amd co-investor in the Australian Climate Change Science Program (ACCSP). The program is funded and administered by the Australian Greenhouse Office, in collaboration with the Bureau of Meteorology Research Centre. Dr Cleugh's component involves collaboration between scientists within CMAR, Ensis and universities within Australia and overseas. 'The research has yielded one of the very few long-term records of evaporation and net ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide in a native eucalypt forest. It demonstrated not only the magnitude of this carbon sink, but also its large variability and vulnerability with recent droughts not only reducing rainfall, but increasing air temperatures.' Dr Cleugh's research also&#160;measures the amounts of carbon dioxide leaving and entering a range of other forest types, crops, vineyards, grasslands, savannas and urban landscapes. This includes the only multi-season, continuous measurements of vineyard water use in Australia, which will underpin improved management of groundwater resources and inform State water allocation plans. The research team has also pioneered wind energy prospecting in Australia and operates a large wind monitoring network that provides information on local wind conditions, including assessing which sites may be suitable for wind farms. Academic qualifications Dr Cleugh was awarded a Bachelor of Science with First Class Honours from the University of Otago, New Zealand in 1981. She was awarded her Doctor of Philosophy from the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada in 1990. Achievements In 2002, Dr Cleugh was an&#160;Erskine Fellow at the Geography Department in the University of Canterbury, New Zealand.
